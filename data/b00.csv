Hello George 

The lock on the bathroom door at the subject flat has a problem that the latch mechanism won            t spring out. See pics.

I have gone and lubricated it but there appears to be a mechanical issue.

Can we have this fixed at your earliest convenience? None of the tenants have had any symptoms of feeling unwell.

See attached pic.

Thank you.

Hello George 

The lock on the bathroom door at the subject flat has a problem that the latch mechanism won            t spring out.         See pics.

I have gone and lubricated it but there appears to be a mechanical issue.

Can we have this fixed at your earliest convenience?         None of the tenants have had any symptoms of feeling unwell.

See attached pic.

Thank you.

Hello George 

I am trying to recall the actions regarding the bathroom lock repair at the subject property. 

Did someone come to complete the repair  or is this still waiting for the end of lockdown; The tenants report that the lock was working but it is not again.

Can you have this attended to?

Thank you.

Hi Elder Anderson  

Work order has already been issued. But due to current lockdown  this type of repair will need to be put on hold until lockdown ends. 

Jimmy will give you call to arrange a time once lockdown restriction changes. 

With thanks

Hello George 

The lock on the bathroom door at the subject flat has a problem that the latch mechanism won            t spring out. See pics.

I have gone and lubricated it but there appears to be a mechanical issue.

Can we have this fixed at your earliest convenience? None of the tenants have had any symptoms of feeling unwell.

See attached pic.

Thank you.

Hi Chris (CRM Team) 

Thanks for listening to me during our phone conversation today. ""Please share the complaint reference as discussed.""

As discussed  I'm hereby writing a formal complaint email about (Tony  Jiayu Wang  Associate Partner  Property Management Property Management Department)

I have contacted him on Monday(27/09/21) initially about an essential repair about the Living Room Door Lock accessing to Balcony is non operational. He has asked me to share the video of what is not working as he couldn't        understand the problem. After I shared the video        with him. He emailed me today        again saying he is confused (Refer email chain below). So I called him to explain exactly what the problem is. 

Tony was very disrespectful and impatient while I was explaining a Life Threatening issue for my family . He said he has no time to listen to me and I was trying to explain  my kids who are 4 yrs & 2 yrs are opening the living room door and trying to climb the balcony glass barrier   which is very dangerous and life threatening.

I was trying to explain   as they are climbing and it is a life threatening issue  can a repair or replacement be done considering the repair as urgent.

Tony says this is not an urgent repair as per PIAs policy and kids should be supervised by parents  that        is not his problem. He could only look into the issue after the Lockdown is eased which is 2 to 3 weeks from now.

I agree that kids need supervision   however working from home doesn't        mean that we will be just looking after kids leaving our work. If the lock was working   then we 100% don't need to supervise the kids.

Can someone from PIA Please get the below 2 requests done ASAP

1.	Door lock repair  before any incident happens.
2.	Change of Property Manager

Expecting a resolution for these issues  once and for all.

Thank you 

Kalyan

"Good Morning 

        

We wish to advise that your tenant is refusing to provide our contractor with access to repair common property cracking.

        

I have also tried calling your tenant to explain the repairs and organise access  however he was quite rude and hung on me.

        

Please note that we require you to organise access and if there is an additional charge for the contractors re-attendance  this will be placed on the lot owners account.

        

Your urgent attention in this matter is greatly appreciated.

Hi Martin  

As you would be aware  the repairs to the front door and the lock are common property items. 

Is the locksmith the preferred supplier of the strata manager? 

This is who all of your tenants should be ringing in the first instance  even after hours. 

Please refer back to them and advise what you find out.

Hi Simon 

        

I will pleased to clarify for you and explain what actually happened.

        

It so happened that the door specialist who attends to the door repairs at VIEWPOINT was actually onsite when we received your request and notification that door lock required repair.

        

The door repair contractor attended and showed patience with the tenants and found that the damage done to the door lock was quite extreme and appeared to be as a result of forced entry or attempted repair gone wrong. It was a Friday afternoon and happened to be the long weekend. I contacted our Locksmith for the Building and I issued a Work Order 

        

The bottom line was is that I copied you into An URGENT Work Order at 4.25pm Friday 2nd October  2020 to GEOFFRO'S DOOR SERVICES (LEPRECHAUN LOCKSMITHS) and when the Strata Locksmith contacted the tenant he was told by the tenant that they had already arranged for another Locksmith to attend.

        

I understand that there were safety concerns however we did issue the Work Order and therefore  for the future  please make it clear to the tenants that under no circumstances are they to engage tradesmen to attend for COMMON PROPERTY REPAIRS. There are Insurance concerns as well as warranty concerns regarding private engagements for common property repairs. For example  say the Locksmith injured himself or now that there might be cause for warranty repair? Please make it clear to the tenant/s that they must not engage any tradesman or handyman for common property repairs.

        

As far as reimbursement is concerned.

        

The tenant will be required to present their BANK DETAILS and an email address so that we can send a remittance advice when we make and EFT.

Hi John 

We have heard from our tenants in the above property that the Strata's tradesman attended to the door lock repair on 02/10/2020 but didn't fix the door lock and also leave the door lock unable to be locked on the day.

The tradesman refused the tenants' request on-site to come back to fix it the next day. Due to the security reason  the tenants engaged a locksmith to fix the unit door lock on 03/10/2020 at $140.        

Can you please reimburse the costs to the tenant?

To: <simonzhangpeng@pia.com.au>

Hi Simon 

        

I will pleased to clarify for you and explain what actually happened.

        

It so happened that the door specialist who attends to the door repairs at VIEWPOINT was actually onsite when we received your request and notification that door lock required repair.

        

The door repair contractor attended and showed patience with the tenants and found that the damage done to the door lock was quite extreme and appeared to be as a result of forced entry or attempted repair gone wrong. It was a Friday afternoon and happened to be the long weekend. I contacted our Locksmith for the Building and I issued a Work Order 

        

The bottom line was is that I copied you into An URGENT Work Order at 4.25pm Friday 2nd October  2020 to GEOFFRO'S DOOR SERVICES (LEPRECHAUN LOCKSMITHS) and when the Strata Locksmith contacted the tenant he was told by the tenant that they had already arranged for another Locksmith to attend.

        

I understand that there were safety concerns however we did issue the Work Order and therefore  for the future  please make it clear to the tenants that under no circumstances are they to engage tradesmen to attend for COMMON PROPERTY REPAIRS. There are Insurance concerns as well as warranty concerns regarding private engagements for common property repairs. For example  say the Locksmith injured himself or now that there might be cause for warranty repair? Please make it clear to the tenant/s that they must not engage any tradesman or handyman for common property repairs.

        

As far as reimbursement is concerned.

        

The tenant will be required to present their BANK DETAILS and an email address so that we can send a remittance advice when we make and EFT.

Hi John 

We have heard from our tenants in the above property that the Strata's tradesman attended to the door lock repair on 02/10/2020 but didn't fix the door lock and also leave the door lock unable to be locked on the day.

The tradesman refused the tenants' request on-site to come back to fix it the next day. Due to the security reason  the tenants engaged a locksmith to fix the unit door lock on 03/10/2020 at $140.        

Can you please reimburse the costs to the tenant?

I am writing to follow up on the previous locksmiths' invoice payment.

As we haven't heard any update from you yet  can you please advise whether the payment has already been processed?

Delay in processing the creditors' invoice will damage our credit rating among the tradesman and affect our reputation.

Will you
please        send me the video that you have mentioned in email  also if you can
help with some pictures will be much appreciated.

        

FYI  the by law
regarding door lock is.

        

If this is the original lock? If it is  then
it is strata issue.

        

If it is not the original then  it is the
owners responsibility as it was not installed as part of the original door and
has been installed after.

        

Look forward to
hearing from you.

"Hi        Simon 

Will you please        send me the video that you have mentioned in email  also if you can help with some pictures will be much appreciated.

FYI  the by law regarding door lock is.

If this is the original lock? If it is  then it is strata issue.

If it is not the original then  it is the owners responsibility as it was not installed as part of the original door and has been installed after.

Look forward to hearing from you.

As of today  we still haven't received the by-law regarding the door lock repair.

Can you please send through today? The lot owner needs to double-check and confirm the invoice payment.

To: <simonzhangpeng@pia.com.au<mailto:simonzhangpeng@pia.com.au>>

Hi Simon 

        

I will pleased to clarify for you and explain what actually happened.

        

It so happened that the door specialist who attends to the door repairs at VIEWPOINT was actually onsite when we received your request and notification that door lock required repair.

        

The door repair contractor attended and showed patience with the tenants and found that the damage done to the door lock was quite extreme and appeared to be as a result of forced entry or attempted repair gone wrong. It was a Friday afternoon and happened to be the long weekend. I contacted our Locksmith for the Building and I issued a Work Order 

        

The bottom line was is that I copied you into An URGENT Work Order at 4.25pm Friday 2nd October  2020 to GEOFFRO'S DOOR SERVICES (LEPRECHAUN LOCKSMITHS) and when the Strata Locksmith contacted the tenant he was told by the tenant that they had already arranged for another Locksmith to attend.

        

I understand that there were safety concerns however we did issue the Work Order and therefore  for the future  please make it clear to the tenants that under no circumstances are they to engage tradesmen to attend for COMMON PROPERTY REPAIRS. There are Insurance concerns as well as warranty concerns regarding private engagements for common property repairs. For example  say the Locksmith injured himself or now that there might be cause for warranty repair? Please make it clear to the tenant/s that they must not engage any tradesman or handyman for common property repairs.

        

As far as reimbursement is concerned.

        

The tenant will be required to present their BANK DETAILS and an email address so that we can send a remittance advice when we make and EFT.

Hi John 

We have heard from our tenants in the above property that the Strata's tradesman attended to the door lock repair on 02/10/2020 but didn't fix the door lock and also leave the door lock unable to be locked on the day.

The tradesman refused the tenants' request on-site to come back to fix it the next day. Due to the security reason  the tenants engaged a locksmith to fix the unit door lock on 03/10/2020 at $140.        

Can you please reimburse the costs to the tenant?

To: <simonzhangpeng@pia.com.au>

Hi Simon 

        

I will pleased to clarify for you and explain what actually happened.

        

It so happened that the door specialist who attends to the door repairs at VIEWPOINT was actually onsite when we received your request and notification that door lock required repair.

        

The door repair contractor attended and showed patience with the tenants and found that the damage done to the door lock was quite extreme and appeared to be as a result of forced entry or attempted repair gone wrong. It was a Friday afternoon and happened to be the long weekend. I contacted our Locksmith for the Building and I issued a Work Order 

        

The bottom line was is that I copied you into An URGENT Work Order at 4.25pm Friday 2nd October  2020 to GEOFFRO'S DOOR SERVICES (LEPRECHAUN LOCKSMITHS) and when the Strata Locksmith contacted the tenant he was told by the tenant that they had already arranged for another Locksmith to attend.

        

I understand that there were safety concerns however we did issue the Work Order and therefore  for the future  please make it clear to the tenants that under no circumstances are they to engage tradesmen to attend for COMMON PROPERTY REPAIRS. There are Insurance concerns as well as warranty concerns regarding private engagements for common property repairs. For example  say the Locksmith injured himself or now that there might be cause for warranty repair? Please make it clear to the tenant/s that they must not engage any tradesman or handyman for common property repairs.

        

As far as reimbursement is concerned.

        

The tenant will be required to present their BANK DETAILS and an email address so that we can send a remittance advice when we make and EFT.

Hi John 

We have heard from our tenants in the above property that the Strata's tradesman attended to the door lock repair on 02/10/2020 but didn't fix the door lock and also leave the door lock unable to be locked on the day.

The tradesman refused the tenants' request on-site to come back to fix it the next day. Due to the security reason  the tenants engaged a locksmith to fix the unit door lock on 03/10/2020 at $140.        

Can you please reimburse the costs to the tenant?

Will you

help with some pictures will be much appreciated.

        

FYI  the by law
regarding door lock is.

        

If this is the original lock? If it is  then
it is strata issue.

        

If it is not the original then  it is the
owners responsibility as it was not installed as part of the original door and
has been installed after.

        

Look forward to
hearing from you.

Hi        Simon 

Will you please        send me the video that you have mentioned in email  also if you can help with some pictures will be much appreciated.

FYI  the by law regarding door lock is.

If this is the original lock? If it is  then it is strata issue.

If it is not the original then  it is the owners responsibility as it was not installed as part of the original door and has been installed after.

Look forward to hearing from you.

So there are a total of 3 downlights that might have the issue of the transformer  as i have tried changing the bulb but they wont turn on.

The more pressing issue is the door handle for the second bedroom  it cannot hold the door close. I need to make appointment with them before they come.

Please let me know their number.

Hi Chris (CRM Team) 

Thanks for listening to me during our phone conversation today. ""Please share the complaint reference as discussed.""

As discussed  I'm hereby writing a formal complaint email about (Tony  Jiayu Wang  Associate Partner  Property Management Property Management Department)

I have contacted him on Monday(27/09/21) initially about an essential repair about the Living Room Door Lock accessing to Balcony is non operational. He has asked me to share the video of what is not working as he couldn't        understand the problem. After I shared the video        with him. He emailed me today        again saying he is confused (Refer email chain below). So I called him to explain exactly what the problem is. 

Tony was very disrespectful and impatient while I was explaining a Life Threatening issue for my family . He said he has no time to listen to me and I was trying to explain  my kids who are 4 yrs & 2 yrs are opening the living room door and trying to climb the balcony glass barrier   which is very dangerous and life threatening.

I was trying to explain   as they are climbing and it is a life threatening issue  can a repair or replacement be done considering the repair as urgent.

Tony says this is not an urgent repair as per PIAs policy and kids should be supervised by parents  that        is not his problem. He could only look into the issue after the Lockdown is eased which is 2 to 3 weeks from now.

I agree that kids need supervision   however working from home doesn't        mean that we will be just looking after kids leaving our work. If the lock was working   then we 100% don't need to supervise the kids.

Can someone from PIA Please get the below 2 requests done ASAP

1.	Door lock repair  before any incident happens.
2.	Change of Property Manager

Expecting a resolution for these issues  once and for all.

Thank you 

Kalyan

"Good Morning 

        

We wish to advise that your tenant is refusing to provide our contractor with access to repair common property cracking.

        

I have also tried calling your tenant to explain the repairs and organise access  however he was quite rude and hung on me.

        

Please note that we require you to organise access and if there is an additional charge for the contractors re-attendance  this will be placed on the lot owners account.

        

Your urgent attention in this matter is greatly appreciated.

Hi Martin  

As you would be aware  the repairs to the front door and the lock are common property items. 

Is the locksmith the preferred supplier of the strata manager? 

This is who all of your tenants should be ringing in the first instance  even after hours. 

Please refer back to them and advise what you find out.

Just to advise you  during removal of the face plate from the bedroom light  Liang has taken a small amount of paint off the wall near the light switch as highlighted in the picture below.

Tiong from Ling Electrical has fixed both the bedroom light switch and laundry powerpoint. Thanks for sorting that!

        

Just to advise you  during removal of the face plate from the bedroom light  Liang has taken a small amount of paint off the wall near the light switch as highlighted in the picture below.

Hello Livia/ Garry 

Trust you are well and had a great time bringing in the New Year.

The tenant of your subject property called to report that the door lock mechanisms in both bathrooms are not working. The screws are still in the lock but the door still opens by just pushing the door lightly.

I went to the unit to check the issue myself and can confirm that the tenant has reported correctly. There is no physical damage but the doors do not lock.

Do you have any handyman who can attend and repair? If yes  please share name and contact details to co-ordinate with the tenant.

I spoke to a few handymen and have received the following quotations from them:

- Best N Fast Trading: $264.00

- Sydney Budget Renovations: $300.00+GST

- L&C Maintenance: $270.00 - $300.00

Kindly advise.

The tenant of your subject property called to report that the door lock mechanisms in both bathrooms are not working. The screws are still in the lock but the door still opens by just pushing the door lightly.

I went to the unit to check the issue myself and can confirm that the tenant has reported correctly. There is no physical damage but the doors do not lock.

Do you have any handyman who can attend and repair? If yes  please share name and contact details to co-ordinate with the tenant.

I spoke to a few handymen and have received the following quotations from them:

- Best N Fast Trading: $264.00

- Sydney Budget Renovations: $300.00+GST

- L&C Maintenance: $270.00 - $300.00

Kindly advise.

Have you contacted any locksmiths for these jobs? Sorry for asking you so many questions  as I have searched the similar quote online finding the quote is a little bit higher than the average.

Since there will be separate cost for repair of bathroom door lock mechanism  do you want me to advise the handyman to repair both issues or would you want me to get separate quotations for lock repair first?

Hello Weiyi 

Thank you for the email.

I have received the following quotations:

- Best N Fast Trading: $88.00 to bypass filter.

- L&C Maintenance: $110.00 to bypass filter

- Sydney Budget Renovations: $110.00 to bypass filter and $275.00 to replace filter.

Kindly advise.

I got a call from the tenant this morning to inform that the door lock mechanism in the bathroom is not working properly. He informed that even if the bathroom door is locked from inside  it can be opened from outside. I asked him to press the door lock properly which he said he has done but it still persists.

Possibly whoever is sent to repair the water flow issue in the kitchen can check and advise on the same.

Hello Weiyi and John 

Trust you are well.

The tenant of your subject property reported that there is negligible water pressure in the kitchen tap in the cold side. However  hot water flow is fine.

This generally happens when the filter in the kitchen tap stops working properly. While the filter needs to be changed at least once every 12 months  this could be expensive. An alternative (and more cost effective) way to rectify this issue is to bypass the filter as tap water in NSW is potable.

Another reason could be that the kitchen mixer needs to be repaired/ replaced.

Do you have any handyman who can attend and repair? If yes  kindly share name and number to co-ordinate with tenants.

If you want us to send someone on your behalf  I can arrange for quotations and share for your review and approval.

Kindly advise.

Kindly advise.

        

I got a call from the tenant this morning to inform that the door lock mechanism in the bathroom is not working properly. He informed that even if the bathroom door is locked from inside  it can be opened from outside. I asked him to press the door lock properly which he said he has done but it still persists.

        

Possibly whoever is sent to repair the water flow issue in the kitchen can check and advise on the same.

Hello Weiyi and John 

Trust you are well.

The tenant of your subject property reported that there is negligible water pressure in the kitchen tap in the cold side. However  hot water flow is fine.

This generally happens when the filter in the kitchen tap stops working properly. While the filter needs to be changed at least once every 12 months  this could be expensive. An alternative (and more cost effective) way to rectify this issue is to bypass the filter as tap water in NSW is potable.

Another reason could be that the kitchen mixer needs to be repaired/ replaced.

Do you have any handyman who can attend and repair? If yes  kindly share name and number to co-ordinate with tenants.

If you want us to send someone on your behalf  I can arrange for quotations and share for your review and approval.

Kindly advise.

Hello Weiyi 

Thank you for the email.

I have received the following quotations:

- Best N Fast Trading: $88.00 to bypass filter.

- L&C Maintenance: $110.00 to bypass filter

- Sydney Budget Renovations: $110.00 to bypass filter and $275.00 to replace filter.

Kindly advise.

I got a call from the tenant this morning to inform that the door lock mechanism in the bathroom is not working properly. He informed that even if the bathroom door is locked from inside  it can be opened from outside. I asked him to press the door lock properly which he said he has done but it still persists.

Possibly whoever is sent to repair the water flow issue in the kitchen can check and advise on the same.

Hello Weiyi and John 

Trust you are well.

The tenant of your subject property reported that there is negligible water pressure in the kitchen tap in the cold side. However  hot water flow is fine.

This generally happens when the filter in the kitchen tap stops working properly. While the filter needs to be changed at least once every 12 months  this could be expensive. An alternative (and more cost effective) way to rectify this issue is to bypass the filter as tap water in NSW is potable.

Another reason could be that the kitchen mixer needs to be repaired/ replaced.

Do you have any handyman who can attend and repair? If yes  kindly share name and number to co-ordinate with tenants.

If you want us to send someone on your behalf  I can arrange for quotations and share for your review and approval.

Kindly advise.

"Noted Weiyi 

Since there will be separate cost for repair of bathroom door lock mechanism  do you want me to advise the handyman to repair both issues or would you want me to get separate quotations for lock repair first?

I have written to all the 3 handymen asking them to provide cost for both repairs to be done at the same time. I will wait for the quotations and your approval before the job order is issued.

Hi Biplav 

I am quite shocking that the fan hasn            t been replaced since I organised the electrician immediate after received your report. 

I just contacted the electrician about what was happening for not fixing the issue. And seems like he mixed up this property with his other client. I have asked him to contact the tenant to have the fan replaced earlier next week. 

By the way  if you have received the report few days ago  you can contact me ASAP so I could have this job done this week. I don            t mind if you call me or sms me for any issue related my properties.

Hello Leanne 

Trust you are well.

I got a call from the tenant of your subject property a few days ago informing me that no one attended to the exhaust fan issue.

I told her that I had confirmation from owner saying she will be sending her own electrician and that I had shared the tenant            s contact number with you.

Request to kindly advise if you had sent an electrician to repair the exhaust fan.

The tenant is once again complaining of issues of mould in the air within the unit and wants to move out. I have informed her that there never was an issue of the mould and that last time I had visited the unit myself with the cleaner and got the washrooms cleaned.

Looks like this might become a tussle and the matter may go to the tribunal. I am planning to visit Barina Park next week and will check the unit for myself.

However  request to kindly send the electrician to repair the exhaust fan  if not sent earlier. If you want me to arrange for the exhaust fan repair  the lowest quotation I have is $160.00 including GST.

Kindly advise.

Hello Leanne 

Trust you are well.

Further to our discussion on the call  I visited the tenant in the unit last week. I also had a cleaner with me who was working on another unit in Barina Park.

The mould had formed in both the bathrooms and one wall of the bedroom (inside the wardrobe).

The tenant had cleaned the wall inside the wardrobe and there is no mould there right now. I checked for any leakage. While there was no leakage  the wall was damp and cold (as compared to other walls). I went to the balcony and realised that the wall is the periphery of the unit (and so is exposed to rains). It may be possible that due to consistent rains in the last few months  the wall would have got wet and mould would have developed. I will discuss this with the Building Management for their inputs as well.

The cleaner checked the toilets and informed that the mould is forming at the brim of the cistern due to continuous water being present in the cistern. He cleaned it for no cost while he was there and I have informed tenant that it is their responsibility to ensure that the mould be cleaned if it comes back again.

I also checked the exhaust fans in both the bathrooms and realised that 1 exhaust fan doesn            t work and therefore ventilation doesn            t happen. This exhaust fan needs to be repaired/ replaced. Have already shared the quotations with you earlier. You can choose a vendor from the suggested quotations or choose your own electrician to repair the same. Kindly advise.

I also checked the letterbox. A lot of letterboxes are open at Barina Park including your unit. The lock needs to be replaced. As informed earlier  had checked with the Building Management  they have informed it is in the owner            s scope.

Kindly advise on the repair of exhaust fan and letterbox to structure the next steps accordingly.

Hello John and Yan 

Trust you are well and had a great Easter weekend.

The tenant of your subject property reported the following issues at the unit:

- Exhaust fan in the ensuite not working

- Letterbox not working

Do you have any vendor who can attend to the above repairs? If yes  kindly share name and number to co-ordinate access with the tenant.

In the meanwhile  I have the following quotations for repair of exhaust fans:

- Sydney Budget Renovations: $160.00+GST

- L&C Maintenance: $150.00

- TCYP Electricals: $200.00+ GST

- B&D Building Solutions: $250.00+GST

Also  I have just got the letterbox lock repaired to a more secular BDS Tubular lock for Unit 39A at Barina Downs through Strathfield Locksmiths. They had quoted $165.00 for the letterbox lock and issuing 2 keys.

Kindly advise if you want us to send a vendor from the above. If yes  I would suggest we send L&C Maintenance for repairing/ replacing the exhaust fan and Strathfield Locksmiths for replacing letterbox lock.

Another major issue highlighted by the tenant is mould in the unit (photos attached). I spoke to the tenant and told them that there was no mould in the unit when it was leased and that she needs to ventilate the unit. I have been confirmed by the tenant that she has been facing this issue for the last few months now and that she has been using mould removal liquids available in the market for the last few months. However  it keeps coming back and is growing rapidly.

Growth of mould could be a serious health related issue which could impact the residents severely and if not treated properly  can cause severe health impact on the residents.

Would you have a vendor who can assess the same in the unit and assist with clearing mould as sending multiple vendors would entail multiple call-out fees. Kindly advise.

Do you have any vendor who can attend to the above repairs? If yes  kindly share name and number to co-ordinate access with the tenant.

In the meanwhile  I have the following quotations for repair of exhaust fans:

- Sydney Budget Renovations: $160.00+GST

- L&C Maintenance: $150.00

- TCYP Electricals: $200.00+ GST

- B&D Building Solutions: $250.00+GST

Also  I have just got the letterbox lock repaired to a more secular BDS Tubular lock for Unit 39A at Barina Downs through Strathfield Locksmiths. They had quoted $165.00 for the letterbox lock and issuing 2 keys.

Kindly advise if you want us to send a vendor from the above. If yes  I would suggest we send L&C Maintenance for repairing/ replacing the exhaust fan and Strathfield Locksmiths for replacing letterbox lock.

Another major issue highlighted by the tenant is mould in the unit (photos attached). I spoke to the tenant and told them that there was no mould in the unit when it was leased and that she needs to ventilate the unit. I have been confirmed by the tenant that she has been facing this issue for the last few months now and that she has been using mould removal liquids available in the market for the last few months. However  it keeps coming back and is growing rapidly.

Growth of mould could be a serious health related issue which could impact the residents severely and if not treated properly  can cause severe health impact on the residents.

Would you have a vendor who can assess the same in the unit and assist with clearing mould as sending multiple vendors would entail multiple call-out fees. Kindly advise.

"Hello Bernadette 

Thank you.

I spoke to the Locksmith who informed it is the same existing lock model. Since a locksmith is not a fire certifier  he wouldn            t be able to provide the certification.

However  the product comes with a fire compliance. I have attached their online manual. Page 1.13 mentions that these locks have been successfully tested to Australian Standard AS1905.1.2005

In the meanwhile  you may also have the same verified with Simon.

Hi Biplav 

I have emailed Simon  but not heard back. If your locksmith provides documentation supporting that it is fire compliant (upon completion) and you submit that to me  then you can go ahead and issue the work order.

They are a lot owner issue. But please bear in mind that the lock must be a fire rated lock  if you plan to replace/repair. It must pass the fire inspection. You must let me know if any changes are going to made to the existing lock. A repair is okay to do  but the lot owner            s expense.

Hello Leanne 

The letterbox doesn            t get locked with the keys. The protruding clip was not rotating when I tried and that is why the letterbox is not locking.

HI Biplav 

Actually my husband went to check the mailbox today. It doesn            t seem broken? Do you mean the key lost? The mailbox door is open  but seems not being locked. 

Could you let me know if just because key lost  just need key cuts rather than replace the lock. Photos attached below.

Hello Leanne 

Trust you are well.

Further to our discussion on the call  I visited the tenant in the unit last week. I also had a cleaner with me who was working on another unit in Barina Park.

The mould had formed in both the bathrooms and one wall of the bedroom (inside the wardrobe).

The tenant had cleaned the wall inside the wardrobe and there is no mould there right now. I checked for any leakage. While there was no leakage  the wall was damp and cold (as compared to other walls). I went to the balcony and realised that the wall is the periphery of the unit (and so is exposed to rains). It may be possible that due to consistent rains in the last few months  the wall would have got wet and mould would have developed. I will discuss this with the Building Management for their inputs as well.

The cleaner checked the toilets and informed that the mould is forming at the brim of the cistern due to continuous water being present in the cistern. He cleaned it for no cost while he was there and I have informed tenant that it is their responsibility to ensure that the mould be cleaned if it comes back again.

I also checked the exhaust fans in both the bathrooms and realised that 1 exhaust fan doesn            t work and therefore ventilation doesn            t happen. This exhaust fan needs to be repaired/ replaced. Have already shared the quotations with you earlier. You can choose a vendor from the suggested quotations or choose your own electrician to repair the same. Kindly advise.

I also checked the letterbox. A lot of letterboxes are open at Barina Park including your unit. The lock needs to be replaced. As informed earlier  had checked with the Building Management  they have informed it is in the owner            s scope.

Kindly advise on the repair of exhaust fan and letterbox to structure the next steps accordingly.

Hello John and Yan 

Trust you are well and had a great Easter weekend.

The tenant of your subject property reported the following issues at the unit:

- Exhaust fan in the ensuite not working

- Letterbox not working

Do you have any vendor who can attend to the above repairs? If yes  kindly share name and number to co-ordinate access with the tenant.

In the meanwhile  I have the following quotations for repair of exhaust fans:

- Sydney Budget Renovations: $160.00+GST

- L&C Maintenance: $150.00

- TCYP Electricals: $200.00+ GST

- B&D Building Solutions: $250.00+GST

Also  I have just got the letterbox lock repaired to a more secular BDS Tubular lock for Unit 39A at Barina Downs through Strathfield Locksmiths. They had quoted $165.00 for the letterbox lock and issuing 2 keys.

Kindly advise if you want us to send a vendor from the above. If yes  I would suggest we send L&C Maintenance for repairing/ replacing the exhaust fan and Strathfield Locksmiths for replacing letterbox lock.

Another major issue highlighted by the tenant is mould in the unit (photos attached). I spoke to the tenant and told them that there was no mould in the unit when it was leased and that she needs to ventilate the unit. I have been confirmed by the tenant that she has been facing this issue for the last few months now and that she has been using mould removal liquids available in the market for the last few months. However  it keeps coming back and is growing rapidly.

Growth of mould could be a serious health related issue which could impact the residents severely and if not treated properly  can cause severe health impact on the residents.

Would you have a vendor who can assess the same in the unit and assist with clearing mould as sending multiple vendors would entail multiple call-out fees. Kindly advise.

Kindly advise on the repair of exhaust fan and letterbox to structure the next steps accordingly.

Hello John and Yan 

Trust you are well and had a great Easter weekend.

The tenant of your subject property reported the following issues at the unit:

- Exhaust fan in the ensuite not working

- Letterbox not working

Do you have any vendor who can attend to the above repairs? If yes  kindly share name and number to co-ordinate access with the tenant.

In the meanwhile  I have the following quotations for repair of exhaust fans:

- Sydney Budget Renovations: $160.00+GST

- L&C Maintenance: $150.00

- TCYP Electricals: $200.00+ GST

- B&D Building Solutions: $250.00+GST

Also  I have just got the letterbox lock repaired to a more secular BDS Tubular lock for Unit 39A at Barina Downs through Strathfield Locksmiths. They had quoted $165.00 for the letterbox lock and issuing 2 keys.

Kindly advise if you want us to send a vendor from the above. If yes  I would suggest we send L&C Maintenance for repairing/ replacing the exhaust fan and Strathfield Locksmiths for replacing letterbox lock.

Another major issue highlighted by the tenant is mould in the unit (photos attached). I spoke to the tenant and told them that there was no mould in the unit when it was leased and that she needs to ventilate the unit. I have been confirmed by the tenant that she has been facing this issue for the last few months now and that she has been using mould removal liquids available in the market for the last few months. However  it keeps coming back and is growing rapidly.

Growth of mould could be a serious health related issue which could impact the residents severely and if not treated properly  can cause severe health impact on the residents.

Would you have a vendor who can assess the same in the unit and assist with clearing mould as sending multiple vendors would entail multiple call-out fees. Kindly advise.

Hello Leanne 

Trust you are well.

Further to our discussion on the call  I visited the tenant in the unit last week. I also had a cleaner with me who was working on another unit in Barina Park.

The mould had formed in both the bathrooms and one wall of the bedroom (inside the wardrobe).

The tenant had cleaned the wall inside the wardrobe and there is no mould there right now. I checked for any leakage. While there was no leakage  the wall was damp and cold (as compared to other walls). I went to the balcony and realised that the wall is the periphery of the unit (and so is exposed to rains). It may be possible that due to consistent rains in the last few months  the wall would have got wet and mould would have developed. I will discuss this with the Building Management for their inputs as well.

The cleaner checked the toilets and informed that the mould is forming at the brim of the cistern due to continuous water being present in the cistern. He cleaned it for no cost while he was there and I have informed tenant that it is their responsibility to ensure that the mould be cleaned if it comes back again.

I also checked the exhaust fans in both the bathrooms and realised that 1 exhaust fan doesn            t work and therefore ventilation doesn            t happen. This exhaust fan needs to be repaired/ replaced. Have already shared the quotations with you earlier. You can choose a vendor from the suggested quotations or choose your own electrician to repair the same. Kindly advise.

I also checked the letterbox. A lot of letterboxes are open at Barina Park including your unit. The lock needs to be replaced. As informed earlier  had checked with the Building Management  they have informed it is in the owner            s scope.

I have been confirmed by the tenant that she has been facing this issue for the last few months now and that she has been using mould removal liquids available in the market for the last few months. However  it keeps coming back and is growing rapidly.

Growth of mould could be a serious health related issue which could impact the residents severely and if not treated properly  can cause severe health impact on the residents.

Would you have a vendor who can assess the same in the unit and assist with clearing mould as sending multiple vendors would entail multiple call-out fees. Kindly advise.

"Hello Jing 

Trust you are well.

This is in reference to the bond finalisation for the vacating tenant of your subject property. Kindly note an amount of $1417.14 has been deducted from the bond of the tenant towards the following repairs:

- remaining arrears: $707.14

- 1 missing FoB: $100.00

- pest control: $100.00

- Fly screen lock broken: $60.00

- 3 walls to be repaired and painted: $450.00

Kindly also note that the ingoing condition report which was filled and signed by the tenant when they moved in mentioned that they did the cleaning privately and hence would not be done at the time of vacating. Therefore  the tenant can't be charged for the same.

I have received 3 quotations for end of lease cleaning:

- L&C Maintenance: $450.00

- SilverRain Holdings: $250.00 + GST

- A1 Professional Cleaning: $350.00+GST

Kindly advise if you would want us to send SilverRain Holdings to get the cleaning arranged for the unit. He is visiting Barina Downs tomorrow for another unit and can attend to the cleaning tomorrow itself.

In the meanwhile  I have written to Strata for issuing 1 FoB.

I have the following quotations for pest control:

- Pest Control Maintenance: $110.00

- KR Pest Control: $132.00

- Safeguard Pest Management: $99.00

Given that the best quotation for pest control was by Safeguard Pest Management  we have deducted $100.00 from the bond for the same.

Given that the new tenant will be moving in this weekend  I can organise the cleaning and pest control in the next 2 days.

Kindly also advise if you would want us to organise the fly screen lock repair and the wall repair or would you be doing them through your vendors. The amounts deducted from the bond are on the basis of the quotations I received from Sydney Budget Renovations.

I look forward to your inputs and guidance to be able to close this at the earliest.

Hello Livia/ Garry 

Trust you are well and had a great time bringing in the New Year.

The tenant of your subject property called to report that the door lock mechanisms in both bathrooms are not working. The screws are still in the lock but the door still opens by just pushing the door lightly.

I went to the unit to check the issue myself and can confirm that the tenant has reported correctly. There is no physical damage but the doors do not lock.

Do you have any handyman who can attend and repair? If yes  please share name and contact details to co-ordinate with the tenant.

I spoke to a few handymen and have received the following quotations from them:

"Hi Biplav 

I am quite shocking that the fan hasn            t been replaced since I organised the electrician immediate after received your report.        

I just contacted the electrician about what was happening for not fixing the issue. And seems like he mixed up this property with his other client. I have asked him to contact the tenant to have the fan replaced earlier next week.        

By the way  if you have received the report few days ago  you can contact me ASAP so I could have this job done this week. I don            t mind if you call me or sms me for any issue related my properties.

Hello Leanne 

        

Trust you are well.

        

I got a call from the tenant of your subject property a few days ago informing me that no one attended to the exhaust fan issue.

        

I told her that I had confirmation from owner saying she will be sending her own electrician and that I had shared the tenant            s contact number with you.

        

Request to kindly advise if you had sent an electrician to repair the exhaust fan.

        

The tenant is once again complaining of issues of mould in the air within the unit and wants to move out. I have informed her that there never was an issue of the mould and that last time I had visited the unit myself with the cleaner and got the washrooms cleaned.

        

Looks like this might become a tussle and the matter may go to the tribunal. I am planning to visit Barina Park next week and will check the unit for myself.

        

However  request to kindly send the electrician to repair the exhaust fan  if not sent earlier. If you want me to arrange for the exhaust fan repair  the lowest quotation I have is $160.00 including GST.

        

Kindly advise.

Importance: High

        

Hello Leanne 

        

Trust you are well.

        

Further to our discussion on the call  I visited the tenant in the unit last week. I also had a cleaner with me who was working on another unit in Barina Park.

        

The mould had formed in both the bathrooms and one wall of the bedroom (inside the wardrobe).

        

The tenant had cleaned the wall inside the wardrobe and there is no mould there right now. I checked for any leakage. While there was no leakage  the wall was damp and cold (as compared to other walls). I went to the balcony and realised that the wall is the periphery of the unit (and so is exposed to rains). It may be possible that due to consistent rains in the last few months  the wall would have got wet and mould would have developed. I will discuss this with the Building Management for their inputs as well.

        

The cleaner checked the toilets and informed that the mould is forming at the brim of the cistern due to continuous water being present in the cistern. He cleaned it for no cost while he was there and I have informed tenant that it is their responsibility to ensure that the mould be cleaned if it comes back again.

        

I also checked the exhaust fans in both the bathrooms and realised that 1 exhaust fan doesn            t work and therefore ventilation doesn            t happen. This exhaust fan needs to be repaired/ replaced. Have already shared the quotations with you earlier. You can choose a vendor from the suggested quotations or choose your own electrician to repair the same. Kindly advise.

        

I also checked the letterbox. A lot of letterboxes are open at Barina Park including your unit. The lock needs to be replaced. As informed earlier  had checked with the Building Management  they have informed it is in the owner            s scope.

        

Kindly advise on the repair of exhaust fan and letterbox to structure the next steps accordingly.

Could you call me to discuss?        

        Would the letterbox should be taking care under strata?

Hello John and Yan 

        

Trust you are well and had a great Easter weekend.

        

The tenant of your subject property reported the following issues at the unit:

-                                                                         Exhaust fan in the ensuite not working

-                                                                         Letterbox not working

        

Do you have any vendor who can attend to the above repairs? If yes  kindly share name and number to co-ordinate access with the tenant.

        

In the meanwhile  I have the following quotations for repair of exhaust fans:

-                                                                         Sydney Budget Renovations: $160.00+GST

-                                                                         L&C Maintenance: $150.00

-                                                                         TCYP Electricals: $200.00+ GST

-                                                                         B&D Building Solutions: $250.00+GST

        

Also  I have just got the letterbox lock repaired to a more secular BDS Tubular lock for Unit 39A at Barina Downs through Strathfield Locksmiths. They had quoted $165.00 for the letterbox lock and issuing 2 keys.

        

Kindly advise if you want us to send a vendor from the above. If yes  I would suggest we send L&C Maintenance for repairing/ replacing the exhaust fan and Strathfield Locksmiths for replacing letterbox lock.

        

Another major issue highlighted by the tenant is mould in the unit (photos attached). I spoke to the tenant and told them that there was no mould in the unit when it was leased and that she needs to ventilate the unit. I have been confirmed by the tenant that she has been facing this issue for the last few months now and that she has been using mould removal liquids available in the market for the last few months. However  it keeps coming back and is growing rapidly.

        

Growth of mould could be a serious health related issue which could impact the residents severely and if not treated properly  can cause severe health impact on the residents.

        

Would you have a vendor who can assess the same in the unit and assist with clearing mould as sending multiple vendors would entail multiple call-out fees. Kindly advise.

        

Best regards

They are a lot owner issue. But please bear in mind that the lock must be a fire rated lock  if you plan to replace/repair. It must pass the fire inspection. You must let me know if any changes are going to made to the existing lock. A repair is okay to do  but the lot owner            s expense.

Hi Biplav 

Thanks for your email!

Please organise everything you mentioned in your email based on your quote.         There is an extra repair needs to be done as well. One of the strip underneath one        of        kitchen cabinet doors         was damaged and off. The tenant girl knew the problem. Could you please get a quote and fix it as well?        

Many thanks!

Hello Jing 

Trust you are well.

This is in reference to the bond finalisation for the vacating tenant of your subject property. Kindly note an amount of $1417.14 has been deducted from the bond of the tenant towards the following repairs:

- remaining arrears: $707.14

- 1 missing FoB: $100.00

- pest control: $100.00

- Fly screen lock broken: $60.00

- 3 walls to be repaired and painted: $450.00

Kindly also note that the ingoing condition report which was filled and signed by the tenant when they moved in mentioned that they did the cleaning privately and hence would not be done at the time of vacating. Therefore  the tenant can't be charged for the same.

I have received 3 quotations for end of lease cleaning:

- L&C Maintenance: $450.00

- SilverRain Holdings: $250.00 + GST

- A1 Professional Cleaning: $350.00+GST

Kindly advise if you would want us to send SilverRain Holdings to get the cleaning arranged for the unit. He is visiting Barina Downs tomorrow for another unit and can attend to the cleaning tomorrow itself.

In the meanwhile  I have written to Strata for issuing 1 FoB.

I have the following quotations for pest control:

- Pest Control Maintenance: $110.00

- KR Pest Control: $132.00

- Safeguard Pest Management: $99.00

Given that the best quotation for pest control was by Safeguard Pest Management  we have deducted $100.00 from the bond for the same.

Given that the new tenant will be moving in this weekend  I can organise the cleaning and pest control in the next 2 days.

Kindly also advise if you would want us to organise the fly screen lock repair and the wall repair or would you be doing them through your vendors. The amounts deducted from the bond are on the basis of the quotations I received from Sydney Budget Renovations.

I look forward to your inputs and guidance to be able to close this at the earliest.

Hello Weiyi 

        

Thank you for the email.

        

I have received the following quotations:

-                                                                         Best N Fast Trading: $88.00 to bypass filter.

Kindly advise.

        

I got a call from the tenant this morning to inform that the door lock mechanism in the bathroom is not working properly. He informed that even if the bathroom door is locked from inside  it can be opened from outside. I asked him to press the door lock properly which he said he has done but it still persists.

        

Possibly whoever is sent to repair the water flow issue in the kitchen can check and advise on the same.

        

Best regards

Hello Weiyi and John 

Trust you are well.

The tenant of your subject property reported that there is negligible water pressure in the kitchen tap in the cold side. However  hot water flow is fine.

This generally happens when the filter in the kitchen tap stops working properly. While the filter needs to be changed at least once every 12 months  this could be expensive. An alternative (and more cost effective) way to rectify this issue is to bypass the filter as tap water in NSW is potable.

Another reason could be that the kitchen mixer needs to be repaired/ replaced.

Do you have any handyman who can attend and repair? If yes  kindly share name and number to co-ordinate with tenants.

If you want us to send someone on your behalf  I can arrange for quotations and share for your review and approval.

Kindly advise.

Kind Regards

Thank you for the email.

        

I have received the following quotations:

-                                                                         Best N Fast Trading: $88.00 to bypass filter.

-                                                                         L&C Maintenance: $110.00 to bypass filter

-                                                                         Sydney Budget Renovations: $110.00 to bypass filter and $275.00 to replace filter.

        

Kindly advise.

        

I got a call from the tenant this morning to inform that the door lock mechanism in the bathroom is not working properly. He informed that even if the bathroom door is locked from inside  it can be opened from outside. I asked him to press the door lock properly which he said he has done but it still persists.

        

Possibly whoever is sent to repair the water flow issue in the kitchen can check and advise on the same.

        

Best regards

Hello Weiyi and John 

Trust you are well.

The tenant of your subject property reported that there is negligible water pressure in the kitchen tap in the cold side. However  hot water flow is fine.

This generally happens when the filter in the kitchen tap stops working properly. While the filter needs to be changed at least once every 12 months  this could be expensive. An alternative (and more cost effective) way to rectify this issue is to bypass the filter as tap water in NSW is potable.

Another reason could be that the kitchen mixer needs to be repaired/ replaced.

Do you have any handyman who can attend and repair? If yes  kindly share name and number to co-ordinate with tenants.

If you want us to send someone on your behalf  I can arrange for quotations and share for your review and approval.

Kindly advise.

Kind Regards

Could you please confirm how many door locks need to be fixed? Two? And the quotations you received        are for repairing only or replacing new locks? Could you please specify? And does each quote apply for one lock repairment or two locks?

Have you contacted any locksmiths for these jobs? Sorry for asking you so many questions  as I have searched the similar quote online finding the quote is a little bit higher than the average.

No problem 

Its not a big issue and would be a very simple 5min fix. 

See below a link to how to fix the problem.

https://www.familyhandyman.com/doors/repair/adjusting-a-door-strike-plate/

Its a simple fix just to sand away some extra metal  I would simply do it myself but didnt want to be responsible as filing the door strike would leave some scratches on the plate.

Hi Iris 

        

Good afternoon. If you remember last month i had informed you (refer 18th May whats app chat) that the washroom lock of Unit 23 was loose and later on (refer 31 May whats app chat) it had got stuck and we had to call the locksmith. I had shared you the receipts        over whatsapp.        

        

Did you get a chance to speak to landlord about this and arrange the refund.

"Hi Bowen 

Currently  the owner account does not have sufficient fund to process the tenant reimbursement.

It will be proceeded accordingly once the owner account has sufficient fund. 

I will let you know once proceeded.

Cheers.

Subject: Unit 23 Washroom Lock repair :

        

Hi Iris 

        

Good afternoon. If you remember last month i had informed you (refer 18th May whats app chat) that the washroom lock of Unit 23 was loose and later on (refer 31 May whats app chat) it had got stuck and we had to call the locksmith. I had shared you the receipts        over whatsapp.        

        

Did you get a chance to speak to landlord about this and arrange the refund.

        

Regards 

Rachit

Hi Chris (CRM Team) 

Thanks for listening to me during our phone conversation today. ""Please share the complaint reference as discussed.""

As discussed  I'm hereby writing a formal complaint email about (Tony  Jiayu Wang  Associate Partner  Property Management Property Management Department)

I have contacted him on Monday(27/09/21) initially about an essential repair about the Living Room Door Lock accessing to Balcony is non operational. He has asked me to share the video of what is not working as he couldn't        understand the problem. After I shared the video        with him. He emailed me today        again saying he is confused (Refer email chain below). So I called him to explain exactly what the problem is. 

Tony was very disrespectful and impatient while I was explaining a Life Threatening issue for my family . He said he has no time to listen to me and I was trying to explain  my kids who are 4 yrs & 2 yrs are opening the living room door and trying to climb the balcony glass barrier   which is very dangerous and life threatening.

I was trying to explain   as they are climbing and it is a life threatening issue  can a repair or replacement be done considering the repair as urgent.

Tony says this is not an urgent repair as per PIAs policy and kids should be supervised by parents  that        is not his problem. He could only look into the issue after the Lockdown is eased which is 2 to 3 weeks from now.

I agree that kids need supervision   however working from home doesn't        mean that we will be just looking after kids leaving our work. If the lock was working   then we 100% don't need to supervise the kids.

Can someone from PIA Please get the below 2 requests done ASAP

1.	Door lock repair  before any incident happens.
2.	Change of Property Manager

Expecting a resolution for these issues  once and for all.

Thank you 

Kalyan

"Dear Cindy  

        

Thank you for your email. 

        

Unfortunately we are unable to provide an extension to the Owner as the due dates are set by the Owners Corporation at its Annual General Meeting  not by our office. 

        

The only advice we can provide you and the Owner is that whilst the due date is 1st July 2021 the Strata Schemes Management Act does state that interest will be charged on an overdue levy once it remains outstanding for 30 days past its due date. (Interest is charged at a rate of 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis on the amount outstanding).

        

Therefore the Owner will not incur interest charges on the July levy if payment is received before 30th July 2021. 

        

However  please note that there is an outstanding balance of $24.26 from the levy that was due 1st April 2021 and that this outstanding levy has accrued $0.38 in interest up to today            s date. We would advise that the arrears be paid as soon as possible to stop any further interest accruing.

        

If you have any other questions  please do not hesitate to contact our office again.

        

Kind Regards

Greetings from PIA.

The lot owner has formally requested an extension of 4 weeks from        09/07/2021  without penalties or interest.

Payment will be submitted prior to the extension date once sufficient funds are available.

        

We thank you for your attention.

         Hi Chris (CRM Team) 

        

Thanks for listening to me during our phone conversation today. ""Please share the complaint reference as discussed.""

        

As discussed  I'm hereby writing a formal complaint email about         (Tony  Jiayu Wang  Associate Partner  Property Management Property Management Department)

I have contacted him on Monday(27/09/21) initially about an essential repair about the Living Room Door Lock accessing to Balcony is non operational. He has asked me to share the video of what is not working as he couldn't        understand the problem. After I shared the video        with him. He emailed me today        again saying he is confused (Refer email chain below). So I called him to explain exactly what the problem is.        

        

Tony was very disrespectful and impatient while I was explaining a Life Threatening issue for my family . He said he has no time to listen to me and I was trying to explain  my kids who are 4 yrs & 2 yrs are opening the living room door and trying to climb the balcony glass barrier   which is very dangerous and life threatening.

        

I was trying to explain   as they are climbing and it is a life threatening issue  can a repair or replacement be done considering the repair as urgent.

        

Tony says this is not an urgent repair as per PIAs policy and kids should be supervised by parents  that        is not his problem. He could only look into the issue after the Lockdown is eased which is 2 to 3 weeks from now.

        

I agree that kids need supervision   however working from home doesn't        mean that we will be just looking after kids leaving our work. If the lock was working   then we 100% don't need to supervise the kids.

        

Can someone from PIA Please get the below 2 requests done ASAP

1.	        Door lock repair  before any incident happens.
2.	        Change of Property Manager

        

Expecting a resolution for these issues  once and for all.

        

Thank you 

Kalyan        

0452533661.

        

Note: I'm also attaching the email chain of the first complaint lodged to PIA in Feb 2021.

Good Morning 

We wish to advise that your tenant is refusing to provide our contractor with access to repair common property cracking.

I have also tried calling your tenant to explain the repairs and organise access  however he was quite rude and hung on me.

Please note that we require you to organise access and if there is an additional charge for the contractors re-attendance  this will be placed on the lot owners account.

Your urgent attention in this matter is greatly appreciated.

Mariah is no longer the strata manager here also  however I have copied Ryan into this email.

I will have Ryan organise for priority one locksmith to come out here. Entrance locks are definitely an emergency if they cannot be locked.

Did they mention why it cannot lock and is this the original lock from the apartment?

Hi Chris (CRM Team) 

Thanks for listening to me during our phone conversation today. ""Please share the complaint reference as discussed.""

As discussed  I'm hereby writing a formal complaint email about (Tony  Jiayu Wang  Associate Partner  Property Management Property Management Department)

I have contacted him on Monday(27/09/21) initially about an essential repair about the Living Room Door Lock accessing to Balcony is non operational. He has asked me to share the video of what is not working as he couldn't        understand the problem. After I shared the video        with him. He emailed me today        again saying he is confused (Refer email chain below). So I called him to explain exactly what the problem is. 

Tony was very disrespectful and impatient while I was explaining a Life Threatening issue for my family . He said he has no time to listen to me and I was trying to explain  my kids who are 4 yrs & 2 yrs are opening the living room door and trying to climb the balcony glass barrier   which is very dangerous and life threatening.

I was trying to explain   as they are climbing and it is a life threatening issue  can a repair or replacement be done considering the repair as urgent.

Tony says this is not an urgent repair as per PIAs policy and kids should be supervised by parents  that        is not his problem. He could only look into the issue after the Lockdown is eased which is 2 to 3 weeks from now.

I agree that kids need supervision   however working from home doesn't        mean that we will be just looking after kids leaving our work. If the lock was working   then we 100% don't need to supervise the kids.

Can someone from PIA Please get the below 2 requests done ASAP

1.	Door lock repair  before any incident happens.
2.	Change of Property Manager

Expecting a resolution for these issues  once and for all.

Thank you 

Kalyan

"Good Morning 

        

We wish to advise that your tenant is refusing to provide our contractor with access to repair common property cracking.

        

I have also tried calling your tenant to explain the repairs and organise access  however he was quite rude and hung on me.

        

Please note that we require you to organise access and if there is an additional charge for the contractors re-attendance  this will be placed on the lot owners account.

        

Your urgent attention in this matter is greatly appreciated.

Hi William

        

Hope you are well.

        

Please be informed that the new tenants have moved in to the subject property today. Could you please organise the main door lock repair at the subject property urgently today?

        

The tenant has also reported that he is not able to access the building with the help of swipe cards provided to him. Could you please check and confirm if the swipe cards for this property are working fine?

        

Your kind assistance in this matter is greatly appreciated.

        

Please do not hesitate to contact me in case you have any queries.

        

Thank you

Subject: 36/300-308 Great Western Highway - Issues getting access and door locks broken/damaged

        

Hi Jun/Nitesh 

        

We tried yesterday to access the property with the keys provided but having some issues. Lift button in the B1 carpark is not working so i had to walk on fire stairs. Also the main access doors were not opening with the keys provided ( maybe issues with building intercom). So i rang unit 37 and 34 to gain access to the property. The keys worker in the lift so i         could go up and down to unit and carpark. The other issue is the unit door lock which is broken and can be opened without the keys. So if you can arrange to fix it ASAP would be appreciated as we have some deliveries coming in this weekend for some appliances and furniture. Thanks.

        

Regards

For your update  a work order has just been sent to the assigned tradesman.

Strathfield Locks will contact you shortly to attend the issue.

For your information  they        can be reached on 0425218846  and email address is neo@strathfieldlocksmiths.com.au<mailto:neo@strathfieldlocksmiths.com.au>.

If you do not hear from anyone who            s been instructed in a timely manner  please notify me to follow up.

Once again  once the tradesman attends only to find misuse/damage caused by the user rather than a fault with the item/matter  I am afraid that the tenant will be liable for any associated charges.

In the meantime  thank you for your patience.

Trust you are well.

Further to my email dated 15/11/2021  your approval for mailbox repair is still awaited.

Your tenant is really worried about missing any letters which he may be receiving from the bank and the government.

Looking at the priority of the job and protect your rental income (as tenant may claim a rent reduction due to delay in the maintenance work)  I am issuing the work order to Strathfield Locks for repair of mailbox.

Hope this is of assistance.

Hi Jun/Nitesh 

        

We tried yesterday to access the property with the keys provided but having some issues. Lift button in the B1 carpark is not working so i had to walk on fire stairs. Also the main access doors were not opening with the keys provided ( maybe issues with building intercom). So i rang unit 37 and 34 to gain access to the property. The keys worker in the lift so i         could go up and down to unit and carpark. The other issue is the unit door lock which is broken and can be opened without the keys. So if you can arrange to fix it ASAP would be appreciated as we have some deliveries coming in this weekend for some appliances and furniture. Thanks.

Subject: 36/300-308 Great Western Highway - Issues getting access and door locks broken/damaged

Hi Jun/Nitesh 

We tried yesterday to access the property with the keys provided but having some issues. Lift button in the B1 carpark is not working so i had to walk on fire stairs. Also the main access doors were not opening with the keys provided ( maybe issues with building intercom). So i rang unit 37 and 34 to gain access to the property. The keys worker in the lift so i could go up and down to unit and carpark. The other issue is the unit door lock which is broken and can be opened without the keys. So if you can arrange to fix it ASAP would be appreciated as we have some deliveries coming in this weekend for some appliances and furniture. Thanks.

Hi Yanfeng Zhou 

Hope all            s well.

For your update  a work order has just been sent to the assigned tradesman.

Strathfield Locks will contact you shortly to attend the issue.

For your information  they        can be reached on 0425218846  and email address is neo@strathfieldlocksmiths.com.au<mailto:neo@strathfieldlocksmiths.com.au>.

If you do not hear from anyone who            s been instructed in a timely manner  please notify me to follow up.

Once again  once the tradesman attends only to find misuse/damage caused by the user rather than a fault with the item/matter  I am afraid that the tenant will be liable for any associated charges.

In the meantime  thank you for your patience.

Hello Livia/ Garry 

Trust you are well and had a great time bringing in the New Year.

The tenant of your subject property called to report that the door lock mechanisms in both bathrooms are not working. The screws are still in the lock but the door still opens by just pushing the door lightly.

I went to the unit to check the issue myself and can confirm that the tenant has reported correctly. There is no physical damage but the doors do not lock.

Do you have any handyman who can attend and repair? If yes  please share name and contact details to co-ordinate with the tenant.

I spoke to a few handymen and have received the following quotations from them:

- Best N Fast Trading: $264.00

- Sydney Budget Renovations: $300.00+GST

- L&C Maintenance: $270.00 - $300.00

In response to your concerns 

1.	Thank you for the reimbursement confirmation and I will proceed further - thank you for your affirmation and encouragement and I will keep looking after your property as our own asset.
2.	Thanks for providing us with the previous conversation history. The previous quote provided by Alliance Maintenance didn't proceed further due to the following reasons.

                                                              - Kevin may be considered saving that $399.00 claimed from the previous tenant for you and postponed the work. The amount was disbursed to you in Nov 2020.

                                                              - The tradesperson attended the property and found the issue is more serious than they originally thought based on the advice from Kevin.

                                                                                          -        The new quote provided by Alliance Maintenance        also includes other maintenance - such as flyscreen doors and the handle lock repair.

                                                                                                To proceed further  I will request these signed creditors to send a separate quotation to clearly show the price of carrying out each specific work rather than giving a mixed price as a whole.        

                                                                                                Also  I would provide with you another 2 quotes to see if there are any better prices we can get.

                                    3. The concern of disbursement fee relates to repair of blocked shower and toilet  and our system is always monitoring and tracking the tenant payments status of outstanding fee.

                                                      In this case  the tenant is still occupying the property. Therefore  there are only 2 x options to recover the cost 

                                                      1. We can lodge the case to NCAT now with a lodgement fee of $52.71 for seeking a money order based on section 187  1        (c) - order to pay an amount of money. 

                                                                                  2. OR we can deduct the costs at the end of the lease agreement from the bond if they fail to pay the invoice upon vacating in future.

                                                                                  My recommendation is not to go with Option 1 since the tenants have shown willingness to renew the lease.

                                                                                  The outstanding $572.00 can be resolved via bond OR NCAT upon vacating.

I hope this information assists you and looking forward to hearing back from you if you have any further concerns.

Hi Jason 

        

Thank you for your response
soon.

        

1. I agree to pay the tenant
$44.02 for replacing and repairing some faulty issues. I appreciate your hard
work and good conversation with the tenant.

        

2. Regarding blinds' issues 
Kevin had reported and emailed me on Mar 12. At meanwhile  I replied him to
agree to use        Alliance        Maintenance
to repair blinds and rails  which will cost me $300 in stead of $935 quoted on
Jun 30. Please see attached conversation mail between Kevin and me on Mar 12.

        

I
don            t know why these issues are not repaired in time and current quotation is
too high. When ending of lease with previous tenant  PM Kevin only charged him
$399 for repairing blinds  (see the statement of March)  but now  you tell me
that I need to pay $935 for it.        Even if the cost of repairing
curtains really costs $935 I don            t think it is myself        responsibility to
afford it. PIA should pay the difference $536 ($935 - $399=$536) because PM
Kevin did not charge the previous tenant enough amount to        repair these
issues.

        

Please try to find an attractive offer for repairs.

        

3. I find that I was charged $572 for urgent repair to clear
blocked shower and toilet due to misuse by tenant who should afford
this        repair in January. But till today  I don            t receive the disbursement
payment of $572 from the tenant. I hope to get $572 disbursement ASAP. Please
see attached Dec Statement and conversation email.

        

Thanks.

        

Best regards

Goodmorning Sherry 

Thanks for your email  and I hope
you and your families are very well.

Please find the doc attached. I
merged all photos into 1 PDF for your convenience  and you can also download
individual photos from the previous email.        

*	In response to your request regarding the blinds dimension  the tradesman normally provides a quote after carrying out measurements on-site.

Unfortunately  they are merely or
unlikely to provide excit dimensions to the third party since they prevent
leaking information to other competitors.

However  I would provide you with a
rough number of the blinds later  but not the dimension for producing or final
installation if you are keen to acquire it.

*	Please also confirm the disbursement payment of $44.02 in replacing 1 x standard Powerswitch and 5 x powerpoints with GPO.

                                            
         As we spoke on the phone last week  we convinced the tenant to replace
these powerpoints by themself and saved more than $400.00 since
tradesmen normally charge $90.00~110.00/each to replace them.

*	We have also convinced the tenants to use the NBN service without a spare battery supply and postpone the battery replacement work  which saves another $100.00.

I hope this information assists you
and looking forward to hearing back from you if any further concerns.

Have a good day.

The tenant has reported below
maintenance issues that require attention & action:

In order to
resolve this issue  please find out the attached quotations for your
consideration 

1.	< ANZ blinds        > - Quoted $1 123.00 (Blinds replacement only)
2.	<        Alliance Living & Construction Pty Ltd        > - Quoted $935.00 (Full maintenance tasks mentioned above)
3.	<        BestNfast        > - Quoted $330.00        (This quotation may vary the amount to the tradesman inspection)

                                                                                                To proceed further  I will request these signed creditors to send a separate quotation to clearly show the price of carrying out each specific work rather than giving a mixed price as a whole.        

                                                                                                Also  I would provide with you another 2 quotes to see if there are any better prices we can get.

                                    3. The concern of disbursement fee relates to repair of blocked shower and toilet  and our system is always monitoring and tracking the tenant payments status of outstanding fee.

                                                      In this case  the tenant is still occupying the property. Therefore  there are only 2 x options to recover the cost 

                                                      1. We can lodge the case to NCAT now with a lodgement fee of $52.71 for seeking a money order based on section 187  1        (c) - order to pay an amount of money. 

                                                                                  2. OR we can deduct the costs at the end of the lease agreement from the bond if they fail to pay the invoice upon vacating in future.

                                                                                  My recommendation is not to go with Option 1 since the tenants have shown willingness to renew the lease.

                                                                                  The outstanding $572.00 can be resolved via bond OR NCAT upon vacating.

Hi Jason 

        

Thank you for your response
soon.

        

1. I agree to pay the tenant
$44.02 for replacing and repairing some faulty issues. I appreciate your hard
work and good conversation with the tenant.

        

2. Regarding blinds' issues 
Kevin had reported and emailed me on Mar 12. At meanwhile  I replied him to
agree to use        Alliance        Maintenance
to repair blinds and rails  which will cost me $300 in stead of $935 quoted on
Jun 30. Please see attached conversation mail between Kevin and me on Mar 12.

        

I
don            t know why these issues are not repaired in time and current quotation is
too high. When ending of lease with previous tenant  PM Kevin only charged him
$399 for repairing blinds  (see the statement of March)  but now  you tell me
that I need to pay $935 for it.        Even if the cost of repairing
curtains really costs $935 I don            t think it is myself        responsibility to
afford it. PIA should pay the difference $536 ($935 - $399=$536) because PM
Kevin did not charge the previous tenant enough amount to        repair these
issues.

        

Please try to find an attractive offer for repairs.

        

3. I find that I was charged $572 for urgent repair to clear
blocked shower and toilet due to misuse by tenant who should afford
this        repair in January. But till today  I don            t receive the disbursement
payment of $572 from the tenant. I hope to get $572 disbursement ASAP. Please
see attached Dec Statement and conversation email.

        

Thanks.

        

Best regards

Goodmorning Sherry 

Thanks for your email  and I hope
you and your families are very well.

Please find the doc attached. I
merged all photos into 1 PDF for your convenience  and you can also download
individual photos from the previous email.        

*	In response to your request regarding the blinds dimension  the tradesman normally provides a quote after carrying out measurements on-site.

Unfortunately  they are merely or
unlikely to provide excit dimensions to the third party since they prevent
leaking information to other competitors.

However  I would provide you with a
rough number of the blinds later  but not the dimension for producing or final
installation if you are keen to acquire it.

*	Please also confirm the disbursement payment of $44.02 in replacing 1 x standard Powerswitch and 5 x powerpoints with GPO.

                                            
         As we spoke on the phone last week  we convinced the tenant to replace
these powerpoints by themself and saved more than $400.00 since
tradesmen normally charge $90.00~110.00/each to replace them.

*	We have also convinced the tenants to use the NBN service without a spare battery supply and postpone the battery replacement work  which saves another $100.00.

I hope this information assists you
and looking forward to hearing back from you if any further concerns.

Have a good day.

Dear Xuesong 

Hope you and your family are very
well. 

The tenant has reported below
maintenance issues that require attention & action:

*	Replace 2 x faulty blinds at the loungeroom
*	Fasten 1 x faulty door lock at bathroom
*	Fixing 2 x faulty fly screen doors at the balcony

        

In order to
resolve this issue  please find out the attached quotations for your
consideration 

1.	< ANZ blinds        > - Quoted $1 123.00 (Blinds replacement only)
2.	<        Alliance Living & Construction Pty Ltd        > - Quoted $935.00 (Full maintenance tasks mentioned above)
3.	<        BestNfast        > - Quoted $330.00        (This quotation may vary the amount to the tradesman inspection)

        

Our recommendation is to choose
<        Alliance Living & Construction Pty Ltd                > for the reasons of most competitive price and quality
service previously been provided.

If you have alternative option or
your preferred tradesman  please do not hesitate to notify us and we can liaise

"Hi Sherry 

Thanks for your email.

I tried to reach you via the phone this afternoon around 6:00 pm but unfortunately  I was unsuccessful.

Please kindly see attached EOFY statement for 2020 - 2021.

In response to your concerns 

1.	Thank you for the reimbursement confirmation and I will proceed further - thank you for your affirmation and encouragement and I will keep looking after your property as our own asset.
2.	Thanks for providing us with the previous conversation history. The previous quote provided by Alliance Maintenance didn't proceed further due to the following reasons.

                                                              - Kevin may be considered saving that $399.00 claimed from the previous tenant for you and postponed the work. The amount was disbursed to you in Nov 2020.

                                                              - The tradesperson attended the property and found the issue is more serious than they originally thought based on the advice from Kevin.

"Hi George 

I emailed you last week about our coverage over the Christmas period and I haven            t heard back  so I assume your regular plumber has you covered for the period.

That            s no problem at all  but I thought I            d send across some info videos that might be useful (especially over Christmas when it might be harder or more expensive to get plumbers onsite). 

If you have tenants reporting blocked sinks  leaking toilets or a hot water system that needs to be lit  before calling a plumber  our how-to videos might help!

You can find these videos and more on our website<ttps://plumbingbros.com.au/plumbing-advice-videos/>. 

Remember we            ve got plumbers available during the entire Christmas period. If you            d like piece of mind that you            ll have a plumber available 24/7  365 days of the year  give me a call.

Have a great Festive period!

Hi George  

Hope you are doing well as discussed on the call couple of months back there are certain things I need you to have a look at the apartment that needs some fixing. First is the buttons on the switch box are broken  second the waters flow in the washroom has is very slow and it takes ages for the hot water to come. And the dryer is making weird noises for some reason. I have attached photos for your reference. Please let me        know if you have any questions or concerns. Thanks

Hey George 

        

I            m here to tell you about a new hot water upgrade program where you may be eligible to upgrade your existing system for just $33. This program has massive incentives from both state and federal Governments from Australia as they push towards net zero.

If you have an electric system at home  you may be eligible to upgrade to a heat pump for just $33 one off supplied and installed. It            s worth a quick two-minute chat George  let            s call and discuss if you            re eligible!

        

Cheers

Hi George 

        

As discussed today  the dishwasher inlet hose is broken which has caused the leaking.

        

The cost to replace the inlet hose is $170 plus GST.

        

Please note that if there is any other issues with the dishwasher we will not be able to fix it.

Hi George 

        

1.        Yes there was a drip from where I the marks are but not too strong  just small drips.

        

2. The dishwasher            s leak seems from the outside. I didn            t want to pull more as it might get worse. That            s why I just isolated the cold water so the leak stops. Not sure what else to say.

For 1          I am not sure that leaking  that could the seal when installing the joinery.         If there is a leaking  you will notice the water dripping.         Better to keep monitor. 

        

2. Dishwasher   so the leaking starts when you trying to pull dishwasher out ? It the leaking from underneath of the dishwasher or somewhere else?

Hi George 

        

The first photo is under the sink. If you notice there are some marks on the joints between under the counter and under the sink. I just assume it might be due to sealing issue but unsure.

        

The second photo is just inside the dishwasher. I cannot take a photo of the leak as it had been cleaned out and also turned off the cold tap. It started when I tried to run the dishwasher but did not work and just kept on having a sound. Looks like        water was not flowing through the hose. I tried to pull the dishwasher out but started leaking. It might be the hose but also not sure. I took off the connection of dishwasher        plug from the socket just to be sure.

Good morning George 

        

Hope all is well.

        

Are you able to organise someone to check and repair our dishwasher? It is not working at the moment and started to leak so we turned off the cold water to stop the leak. Now we are only using hot water tap in the kitchen basin.

I also noticed there is a small leak  seems it might be        coming from a sealing from the left kitchen sink.        

        

Please let us know when someone can attend so we can try to get someone to be here that schedule.

        

Thank you.

"Hi George        

You said the below and I am just confused on some points.        

*	Rent in advance

Your rent must always be paid two weeks             in advance  paid        three        working days before the due date. It is always easily to forget so we always suggest you to schedule your payment via Bpay from your financial institution. Please note that your payment due day is every        Wednesday per week / fortnight.

Just a question about rent payment. I            m just confused on when to pay?        

is it next Wednesday for the first payment or the one after? And when do I transfer the money  on a Friday then?        

Just confused on the dates of when what is due and I don            t want to make a mistake.        

Thanks

Hi Jasmine  

        

For laundry tap under the sink  please refer to attached photos.

        

I am not able to circle the hot water tap under sink          but circled the cold one  the laundry tap will have water when the circle one has the cap on and turn on if no washing machine. 

        

Almost all residents have washing machine so when connected then turn on the tap under sink  the laundry tap will work.

Hi George        

        

I            m moving in today and noticed a couple urgent things.        

The lock on the sliding door in the bedroom is broken and not locking properly  the water in the laundry isn            t turning on & the tap in the bathroom is leaking        

        

Main concern is the lock on the bedroom sliding door  that will need to be fixed asap for safety reasons.        

        

Thanks!

Hi Fiona  

        

Just to give you another update. Tenant has gone back to the property from work and I have advised tenant to disconnect the hot water system power from the wall GPO and re-plug in after 5 mins then turn on wall taps to hot let running for a while. 

        

Now the hot water is restored and I will keep you posted. 

        

Have a good weekend. 

        

With thanks

Hi 

We woke up this and realise the hot water system has stopped working. I have checked the fuse box outside and everything seems to powered properly. Can you get someone to look at it urgently because we can't run on cold water.        

I have left the side gate open to gain access into the premises. I won't be back home until 4pm today. Please kindly ensure the hot water system is fixed today because it's winter season.

        

Hope to hear        from you soon.

        

Regards

Henry

Ok  thanks George.         

        

So  there is no cheaper option to just to check the dishwasher hot water issue? The reason for this question is the repairing cost is almost equal to a new dishwasher.        

If there are no options and If the vendor is a good one  then please arrange it to be checked.

Hi Chitra  

        

Hope you are well. 

        

Further to subject line property dishwasher not heating and bedroom door lock issue.         I have visited the unit last week and found the following:

        

1.	Dishwasher has hot water on and off and it stops having hot water today  it may need to engage a technician to attend;                 

The technician we used is from appliance guy and they require a pretty high pre-approval repair limit of $490.00   if under they will repair onsite  otherwise they will not repair and provide quote for replacement; 

Or I can seek for a quote for replacement first and let you know consider;

        

1.	Bedroom door lock issue; It is a lever set issue  quotes are following:

                                                 Alliance maintenance : $150.00 inc gst to repair  if not repairable          $230.00 INC GST to replace with the closest possible matched to existing;

                                         BYS: Option 1         replace door handle $150.00;         or $200.00 to replace a privacy lock;

        

        

Please kindly advise your thoughts.

For the bedroom door lock  from the photo you sent  I think it is just loose          once you twist the cover off you can use a screw driver to tighten it up  or if you don            t know how  I may be around the area tomorrow or day after can help you with it; 

        

For dishwasher hot water          there are two dishwasher taps  one is cold and other one is hot under sink  can you check whether the hot one has been turned off ?

Hi Chitra  

        

Hope you are well. 

        

Further to subject line property dishwasher not heating and bedroom door lock issue.         I have visited the unit last week and found the following:

        

1.	Dishwasher has hot water on and off and it stops having hot water today  it may need to engage a technician to attend;                 

The technician we used is from appliance guy and they require a pretty high pre-approval repair limit of $490.00   if under they will repair onsite  otherwise they will not repair and provide quote for replacement; 

Or I can seek for a quote for replacement first and let you know consider;

        

1.	Bedroom door lock issue; It is a lever set issue  quotes are following:

                                                 Alliance maintenance : $150.00 inc gst to repair  if not repairable          $230.00 INC GST to replace with the closest possible matched to existing;

                                         BYS: Option 1         replace door handle $150.00;         or $200.00 to replace a privacy lock;

Thanks for your email. 

        

For the bedroom door lock  from the photo you sent  I think it is just loose          once you twist the cover off you can use a screw driver to tighten it up  or if you don            t know how  I may be around the area tomorrow or day after can help you with it; 

        

For dishwasher hot water          there are two dishwasher taps  one is cold and other one is hot under sink  can you check whether the hot one has been turned off ?

Hi Sreeni  

Thanks for your email. 

For the bedroom door lock  from the photo you sent  I think it is just loose  once you twist the cover off you can use a screw driver to tighten it up  or if you don            t know how  I may be around the area tomorrow or day after can help you with it; 

For dishwasher hot water  there are two dishwasher taps  one is cold and other one is hot under sink  can you check whether the hot one has been turned off ?

"Hi George

        

As I do not have the skill set to tackle this problem and nor should I be ask to this repair work as I could damage the Dishwasher.

I believe it should be carried out by a qualified technician that knows why the water is not heating up properly.

        

I clean the filter on a weekly basis.

        

Thanks and regards

I've sent photos for the condition report. i just wanted to add that there are multiple scuff marks on all the walls & moisture & water damage is there on bathroom doors. There is a hair dryer stuck between the railing & metal wall of        balcony. 

There is mold on the sky roof windows walls (very near to the sky roof window) probably        due to constant rains. 

We dont have hot water in the kitchen sink but will check if there is any valve/tap underneath. Dishwasher        has lot of food & mould stuck (photos attached).

I would like to update you that the kitchen mixer has no hot water issue fixed. The existing mixer has some issues and a new mixer has been installed. Working all good now. 

No further action is required from your end and I will process your rental income. 

Apart from the above  I have BCC you in an email in relation to the main bathroom toilet filling out water slow. Would you like me to engage Sydney Budget Renovation to check then provide quote            

The subject line tenant reported no hot water in the kitchen and sometimes the kitchen draining slow. 

For no hot water from kitchen mixer  highly likely to be a mixer issue and worst case  replacing $170.00+ GST. 

For kitchen drain slow  I have visited the unit before and uninstall all pipe under the sink  but it does sometimes water drain slow  and not sure what causes it. 

My suggestion is. I can let Sydney Budget Renovation go check the kitchen how water issue if confirmed it is a kitchen mixer issue then replace the mixer. 

In the meanwhile  Sydney Budget Renovation can check the kitchen drainage issue to see whether he can fix it. 

Please advise your thoughts?

Re: Kitchen water/tap

We've communicated about this previously - the hot water  as well as the drainage issues.

I've lived with these issues  but now (1) the flow of both hot and cold water is less than 30% now  ie seems        to have gotten worse (2) tonight  no hot water from the kitchen tap.

(3) drainage issue of the kitchen tubs remains

I apologise for the inconvenience  but the kitchen tap/water issues        seem to be getting worse  and now no hot water. I think valves need to be changed??

I will wait for your advice. Thank you as always for your help.

HI Teena 

In this case  I will need to seek approval from owner arrange a technician to go out.

May I have the serial number of the dishwasher and brand ?

And confirm the dishwasher stops when filling up the water in middle of the washing circle and cannot complete the full circle.

With thanks

Good morning George 

The water pressure is better but the dishwasher is still not cycling            it seems the two aren't related. I've tried all the troubleshooting from the manual and nothing is helping.

Hey George  

It seems to only be the kitchen.

I will look at the tap when I get home from work. The dishwasher has only stopped filling up since the water pressure has dropped. I clean the filter at least twice a week even every couple of days and have also turned it off and on.

I've tried the troubleshooting and it just won't fill up or cycle.

Hi Teena 

Is kitchen could water pressure normal ? or only affect kitchen area  not other areas in the unit ? If only in the kitchen  please refer to attached photo  I have circled the part that you can twist off  then you can see the water restrictor  clean it if not working  remove it then put it back on see how it goes.

Dishwasher not working  can you advise what exactly the issue   have you tried to clean the filter and turn it off then turn back on. ( Please refer to the manual for more details)

Hey George  

There seems to be an issue with the water pressure in the kitchen of our unit.

It's very weak n takes a very long time for the hot water to come through...as a result and I'm not sure why our dishwasher isn't working either...could we please have it looked at.

Thank you

Hi George 

Please find attached property report with our comments and some photos.

We will appreciate if towel railing  wardrobe door and range hood filters can be replaced/repaired.

Water flow in Wash basin is too slow which leads to significant delay in getting hot water.        

Thanks George.

Have a great festive season and happy New Year.

Take care and stay safe.

Hey George         

        

There seems to be an issue with the water pressure in the kitchen of our unit.

It's very weak n takes a very long time for the hot water to come through...as a result and I'm not sure why our dishwasher isn't working either...could we please have it looked at.

        

Thank you        

Teena Darnell

"Good morning George 

The water pressure is better but the dishwasher is still not cycling            it seems the two aren            t related. I            ve tried all the troubleshooting from the manual and nothing is helping.

Looks like some wrong with the pressure. Give a go to the tap  sometimes that will affect the pressure. 

        

Let me know how it goes next week. 

        

Have a good weekend and stay safe.

Hey George         

        

It seems to only be the kitchen.

I will look at the tap when I get home from work. The dishwasher has only stopped filling up since the water pressure has dropped. I clean the filter at least twice a week even every couple of days and have also turned it off and on.

I            ve tried the troubleshooting and it just won            t fill up or cycle.

Hi Teena  

        

Is kitchen could water pressure normal ? or only affect kitchen area  not other areas in the unit ? If only in the kitchen  please refer to attached photo  I have circled the part that you can twist off  then you can see the water restrictor  clean it if not working  remove it then put it back on see how it goes. 

        

Dishwasher not working  can you advise what exactly the issue   have you tried to clean the filter and turn it off then turn back on.         ( Please refer to the manual for more details) 

        

With thanks

"Hi George 

Thanks for your prompt action. 

Just a quick update. I got contacted by the hot water company and was advised that they will reach out to you again and send you another quote. From what I understood  they may need to replace the whole water heating device (the one outside) as apparently it            s an old model. I didn            t quite understand all the details.  

Once their new quote is accepted they will contact me again to book a time to come over and fix the issue.

Hi George 

Apologies  we didn            t know that living area electricity outage is not a strata issue  nor your contact number that we could message directly. Contacting the electrician            s number on strata emergency contact paper was the only thing we could do yesterday as it was urgent happening on a public holiday. 

Now that we know your number  we will make sure to contact you directly if such unexpected things are to happen in the future. 

Regarding the payment  we are still waiting for an invoice from David (the electrician). Should we send it through to you when we receive it? 

Kind regards

Also I need to be in contact with building manager as to where our meter is. AGL requires me to send them a hot water meter reading urgently and I can only locate the gas meter.

Hi George 

Please find attached property report with our comments and some photos.

We will appreciate if towel railing  wardrobe door and range hood filters can be replaced/repaired.

Water flow in Wash basin is too slow which leads to significant delay in getting hot water.        

Thanks George.

Have a great festive season and happy New Year.

Take care and stay safe.

Hi George 

We need to report a power issue in the unit. The circuit breaker for the kitchen keeps tripping. The only appliances plugged in are fridge oven and the hot water  but the circuit keeps blowing  thus leaving us with no hot water and a risk to the items in fridge/freezer.  It has been fine until this morning. Please advise

Long time no talk. The subject line tenant reported to us the common bathroom washing basin tap was faulty  hot water cannot be turned off.         Video attached.        

Kitchen taps have a similar issue.

Subject: Changing water taps

Hi George

It just brought to my attention that the hot water kept runing the whole night. No matter how tightly I turned it off  it kept flowing.

Not only the bathroom also the kitchen taps as well.

I urgently request the landlord to change water taps to lifting ones. It is the fourth such problem happens in this year and now even worse.

Please refer to the attached videos.

Thanks

Regards

Dora

We need a urgent check of the electrical switchboard. One of the switches on the electrical box is always going off and now it's permanently off. I have tried putting it on back  but it switched off very 3 seconds.

Currently all electrical sockets are not working. No hot water and the garage door is not opening presumably because of this switch that has tripped off. 

Please treat as urgent as we really need got water and the electrical sockets working ASAP today. You can reach me on my mobile for any other clarifications.

"Hi George 

Hope you are well. Prior to the tenants moving in  I just wanted to update you with a few things re Revesby:

1. I            ve done my best to clean the oven. A lot of the residue has been baked on and is difficult to remove without damaging the oven door. Attached are a few final photos.        

2. The ground floor has also been wiped down and vacuumed. Attached are also some photos.

3. I            ve turned the master circuit breaker back on as the hot water requires electricity. Just want to ensure the tenants have hot water when they move in.        

4. I plan to terminate the current electricity contract on the 11 Sept  the same day of the lease commencement. Can you let the new tenants know to arrange an electricity plan.        The NMI for the electricity meter is        41035188670.        If the tenants are interested  the current electricity provider is Origin Energy.        

5. As we now have a tenant  can you arrange management and future payment of the strata and water and council rates from rent collected. I            ve attached previous notices for your reference.

6. I            ve provided a copy of the building by-laws. Can you please forward this for the tenants consideration.        

7. Lastly  there is a building manager on the promises. Should the tenants need to contact him  his details are below. Can you please forward his details to the tenants.

"Hi George 

My son told me last night that the problem might not be the dryer because it tripped off even without the dryer on. He thinks that he used a hair dryer and heater was on too and it tripped off  so it might be the overall lighting issue. Give me a few days and I will note if it's only        the dryer isse. No point in replacing the dryer if it's not needed.

Hi George 

I just went to the balcony to check if everything is ok and realised that whole balcony is full of water. Almost 10 cm high water is collected. Looks like the drainage doesn            t work. I hope it doesn            t rain more at night and water seeps in. 

I will check tomorrow morning again but the drainage needs to be looked at I guess.

Hi George 

Looks like there was an error. I set up the direct debit to be deducted the rent from 1/09 because that            s when my rent was due. But looks like I didn            t specify the dates. I will cancel the payment due on 1/09 because now I have paid the rent upto 15/09. That means my next payment is due in 15/09. 

Please confirm this is correct

"Thanks George 

Jimmy is coming        soon. One more thing I noticed is that the kitchen tap is extremely slow and there is no hot water. It gets slightly warm and then goes cold again. It might be just that some        tap is not opened  I tried but couldn't work it out. Can I show Jimmy that too?

Kind regards 

Nanda

Hi George 

I just went to the balcony to check if everything is ok and realised that whole balcony is full of water. Almost 10 cm high water is collected. Looks like the drainage doesn            t work. I hope it doesn            t rain more at night and water seeps in. 

I will check tomorrow morning again but the drainage needs to be looked at I guess. 

Kind regards

Hi George 

Looks like there was an error. I set up the direct debit to be deducted the rent from 1/09 because that            s when my rent was due. But looks like I didn            t specify the dates. I will cancel the payment due on 1/09 because now I have paid the rent upto 15/09. That means my next payment is due in 15/09. 

Please confirm this is correct

Hi Kris  

        

Thanks. Will process.

        

Just would like to clarify  the leaking is from shower screen as its seal failed? 

        

Or other part of water proofing also failed ?         As the water also get into the common hallway outside of the property as well.

        

With thanks

I knocked on the tenants door yesterday with no luck. However did not call. 

Strata has approved sending out a plumber. I will chase him to see the time/date he can attend.

Hi Tony  

Hope you are well. 

We have helped subject line tenant to arrange a plumber to attend the kitchen drainage issue. 

The plumber has advised the following: They had put in almost a bottle of Sulphuric acid and had used a drain cleaner with wire length of plus 7meters to fix the issue.

The issue was resolved back then but I have inspected the property yesterday and if turn on the kitchen water taps  the water will build up after 1 or 2 mins and the pipe under the kitchen sink is all clear. 

I would like to suggest to look into this issue as lower level is a shop front and it could cause a problem in future.

Hi George  

In terms of the below incident   we had called the plumber whose contact you provided and they fixed the issue.

They had mentioned the block seems to be way down beyond the flat and could also be a strata responsibility. They had put in almost a bottle of Sulphuric acid and had used a drain cleaner with wire length        of plus 7meters to fix the issue.

Lately        we have again noticed the water from the kitchen basin is draining quite        slowly   please see if we can get the strata involved  as I believe this could be a bigger issue.

Hi George

Im happy to send our plumber out there and should the problem be within unit they will pass on invoice to you.

Did you want to see if hot water works before I send out plumber?

Also  I believe I called Sajit to inspect crack / plumbing and he had no idea about the call. Correct me        if I am wrong please.

Hi George  

In terms of the below incident   we had called the plumber whose contact you provided and they fixed the issue.

They had mentioned the block seems to be way down beyond the flat and could also be a strata responsibility. They had put in almost a bottle of Sulphuric acid and had used a drain cleaner with wire length        of plus 7meters to fix the issue.

Lately        we have again noticed the water from the kitchen basin is draining quite        slowly   please see if we can get the strata involved  as I believe this could be a bigger issue.

Hello George

        

I am writing to inform you that there was a leakage of water from floor near laundry room. Our carpet was wet yesterday without water spilled from toilet or washing machine.

Please see a video attached.

",a0_8044,b39
"Hi  George 

I am relieved to know the cleaning and the condition are OK. Thank you for your help with the downlight! 

Oil Grease??? I cleaned it thoroughly a few times before moving! I took off the cover and washed with detergents        and hot water. I also wiped all the grease inside of the cover. Probably I missed some parts. Umm  I cannot get to the level of a professional        cleaner. Thank you very much for your kindly taking care of it. I am sorry for bothering you. I should have asked the professional cleaner. 

(BTW  I am in a motel in QLD until I can find permanent accommodation. As their cleaning of glasses is not good. I am very tempted to buy a Windex and start clearing        them! I also wiped various places of the room to get rid of all the dust with leftover cloths from cleaning the Unit 13. It is a motel with quite relaxed services... ) 

As for your question about the wall under the air conditioner  the job is done by the contractor PIA sent to fix the leak of the air conditioner        in 2016  the first year of living in the unit. You sent a few contractors to fix the leak but they could not fix it. Then  the last one you sent could fix it. At that time  he moved the position of the air conditioner as the leak was caused by the height of the air conditioner is lower than the ducts of water to the outside. Then  there is a wall left with a hole under the air conditioner. The contractor        covered the wall at that time. 

So  if you check who fixed the air conditioner in the unit in 2016  that is the person who did that wall. As I noticed it was a rough job  I sent a photo to PIA and informed about it. I hope that you should have the information who you sent for fixing it. Pls note that was the last person who actually fixed the air conditioner. Not the first few people you sent but could not fix the leak. 

I will check if I still have the old email sent to PIA with regards to the air conditioner and will forward to you.

p.s. The real estate here is very different in Warwick! They ask the application for the property first and will take only selected people to inspections individually. No open inspection! They don't have many rental properties. Many people live in their        own properties. I guess there are not many investing        properties. But         these days  many people move from the cities. So  it is harder to find decent rental properties than I expected. I hope that I can find a place I love to live in the end! Oh  rental and sales properties are cheaper than Sydney  of course! 

Best regards 

Mayumi Takei 

2020            12            18            (           ) 9:25 George Si Zhou <georgezhou@pia.com.au<mailto:georgezhou@pia.com.au>>:

Hi Mayumi 

Hope you are well and already arrived Queensland. 

Further to the outgoing inspection  the property is returned in a clean and the condition is in line with normal wear and tear. 

As per discussion  I will help you to replace the laundry down light.

However  some minor issue I need your clarification: 

The lounge AC wall  please see photo attached. It looks it has been patched before  could you advise who has conducted the job ?

Apart from above  there is still a bit        oil grease on the range hood  but I will take care it for you. 

Please let me know the AC wall patch ?

With thanks

Hi George 

Kris has advised that the         controller might have to be replaced but he would have to send a Technician to go past and assess it.

Did you want us to book a job in to do so?

Hi        George

        

Sorry to have to contact you at this time of the year.        

        

Two days ago  the gas hot water control panel in the kitchen started beeping everytime we triggered the hot water. It seems to me there might be a problem with the thermostat. There is still hot water coming through at the moment but would love for a gas technician to come out        and check it out. I'm worried that it will lead to a big gas bill. We've already tried turning it off and on again and it continues to beep. Please see the        attached video.        

        

We will be available most of next week if someone can be organised.        

        

Regards

Tara

"Hi  George!        

Thanks for your support with my moving out.        

I am sorry for my delay to the                       meeting for returning the keys. It took much more time for cleaning. The carpet cleaner you introduced was so good and he explained how to clean nicely. I tried my best and you can see shiny clean unit! But thinking of time and effort  I will ask the professional to clean the next time as you advised.

As for the stain at the sink became less obvious after the last cleaning. I send you the last photo.        

I also found a small chip at the corner of a wall in the bedroom. I might hit it with a vacuum cleaner or removalist moving furniture. I am not sure. I am sorry         

I also noticed some small damage on the wall just in front of drawers in the Bedroom. You need to look carefully to find them. I attached the photo.        

The corner of the sink in the bathroom is chipped. But that was like that when I moved in and I reported to PIA on the document to move in.        

Other than that  I hope the condition of the unit should be ok.        

One thing I need to ask you to pass on message to the next tenant is the cap of cold water under the sink of the laundry. The carpet cleaner said the rubber is not attached to the cap and cold water will leak under the sink if a tenant use cold water in the sink. He advised not to use the cap and cold water. The next tenant can attach the washing machine on the tub of cold water. Then there is no problem. Until then he/she can use only hot water tub. I remember it happened when I moved in  too.

I left the cap on the sink as the tenant can         see it. Could you pass on this message to him/her. I hope he/she does not want to have a wet carpet on the first day of moving in.

I also left the Downlight you mentioned  air conditioner controller  a metal left when I moved in and a cord left around model area. If you think the latter two are not necessary  please throw them away. As I could not judge  I left them.        

Thank you for changing the light for me!        

I left the instruction booklet of hot water boiler (?) under the sink of the kitchen  I received the other instruction booklets digitally.        

I did not change the password if security machine at the entrance door. So the password is the original.        

        

Thanks again for your help with my living at the unit. You are always helpful and I enjoy living there. I hope the owner will find         a new tenant soon.        

Thank you again and have a lovely day!        

I will send you the photos separately        

Best regards

Mayumi

Hi  George!        

        

As for returning the key  could I come to return the key around 10:30 instead of 2:00 tomorrow?        

        

The carpet cleaner came this morning ( the original plan was in the afternoon) and it is sunny day  which makes carpet dry well by tomorrow morning.        

        

As I will drive off to Central Coast  it is more convenient to drive up there tomorrow. So  I wonder if you can change the time.        

        

Another thing is that I am sorry but I got accidentally stain in the sink of a bathroom two days ago. I tried various things to take off the stains. But it became worse. So  I stop cleaning from there. In the last few days! I am very shocked as I kept the place clean the last 4 years.    °         ­ I am terribly sorry.        

        

I attach the photo. Have a look.        

        

Pls confirm the time tomorrow.        

        

Thank you.

apartment is currently out of electricity and hot water on one side (both
bathroom            s hot water and bedroom            s electricity is unable to use). However the
one in the kitchen are functioning normally. I believe it is because the
electricity system tripped. As this is a very urgent situation  how should I
solve this as soon as possible? Please reply.

Thanks for your help.

We are also puzzled with the hot water device. We are unsure on how to use it efficiently. Would there be a user manual or someone to explain to us?.

I already searched it on the net but it gets too technical.

Hi Greg  

Thanks for your email. 

For the wash machining cold and hot water taps  they are under the laundry sink in the laundry room. 

For the recycle and waste bins area  I know they have one on the Russell st  near the mail box area. 

But I think they may should have another one in the building  Let me check with strata and let you know. 

With thanks

Main bathroom exhaust        fan is not working. During this winter time  it is really essential. Otherwise mould will come soon as we don;t have window in the bathrooms. 

As well as some days back I informed that kitchen tap is not working correctly as it is too hard to open and close. A person came to fix the tap issue but didn't replace. Now it is more harder than previous        and it is hard to change from cool water to hot water as well.

Please fix those 2 issues as soon as possible.

Thank you

Dear All 

Due to the uncertainty of COVID-19 going around  the current Rental Guarantee Version 2.1 is invalid from now on. It will be replaced by Version 2.2 in the near        future and enclosed with below key amendments  Thanks for your        understanding.

*	Where the property is vacant  the rent guarantee commences when a tenant commences payment under executed Residential Tenancy Agreement or forty-two (42) days after the execution of this Guarantee  provided that:

       · a) The Landlord(s) have executed a managing agency agreement with PIA; and

b) All documents have been provided as set out in this Guarantee; and 

c) The property is clean and  in a condition that is fit for PIA to procure a tenant at a market price; 

d) All basic facilities and services including gas  electricity  hot water and internet connectivity are readily available; and

e) PIA has been provided with keys  access devices and appliance remotes sufficient for PIA to attend the property and for PIA to acquire unhindered access to carry out its functions.

*	The Rental Guarantee is for a period of 156 weeks from the commencement of the guarantee. PIA may in its direction elect not to pay FWGR where the property is vacant upon commencement  a tenant has vacated or a tenant has received free rent. This clause only empowers PIA to make such an election for no more than forty-two        (42) days (vacancy allowance) in the term of this guarantee.

Hi bernadette         

We attended site today and found that unit 77 washing machine hose was leaking into the service duct and into the carpark. Please find our below report and attached photos.        

        

Attend site to investigate the water within the carpark from the above units of 73 76 77 and 80.

-Arrived onsite and met with the building manager Anthony and began to investigate the water leak within the carpark.        

-We gained access into unit 73 and ran tests within the laundry to find no leak occur into the car park below.        

-We cut a square hole into the common service duct and found water to be dripping down the pipe indicating the leak is occurring higher than unit 73.        

-Located above unit 73 is unit 77.        

-We gained access within unit 77 and investigated under the laundry sink to find large amounts of water on the floor.        

-We tracked the leak to be coming from the hot water washing machine hose.

-We ran all other testings within the unit and found no leaks as the washing machine hose has been leaking for a few weeks as indicated by the tenet.        

-This is an owners responisibilty and as advised not to replace the hose by anthony the building manager.        

-We turned off the hot water valve for the washing machine and isolated the leak.

-We also advised the tenet of unit 77 to contact there agent in regarding the washing machine hose.        

-We advised all other units we will not require access as the leak was found.        

-We covered the hole created within unit 73 with a sticky cover plate for future access.        

-We advised all issues with the building manager while we were onsite.

"Good Morning George  

Just thought of sending a quick note for several things:

1. Previously reported issue with the lights  has now been resolved.

2. Previously reported issue with the plumbing  has also been resolved it turned out that by putting lots and lots of hot water through it clear whatever it was in the drain. 

3. This is more of a question: due to the current situation        is our landlord thinking about the impact it might have financially on both parties in the case it becomes difficult for us to pay the rent on time. At the moment we are ok  but I want to know what are my        options if worst comes to worst?

Hi bernadette         

We attended site today and found that unit 77 washing machine hose was leaking into the service duct and into the carpark. Please find our below report and attached photos.        

        

Attend site to investigate the water within the carpark from the above units of 73 76 77 and 80.

-Arrived onsite and met with the building manager Anthony and began to investigate the water leak within the carpark.        

-We gained access into unit 73 and ran tests within the laundry to find no leak occur into the car park below.        

-We cut a square hole into the common service duct and found water to be dripping down the pipe indicating the leak is occurring higher than unit 73.        

-Located above unit 73 is unit 77.        

-We gained access within unit 77 and investigated under the laundry sink to find large amounts of water on the floor.        

-We tracked the leak to be coming from the hot water washing machine hose.

-We ran all other testings within the unit and found no leaks as the washing machine hose has been leaking for a few weeks as indicated by the tenet.        

-This is an owners responisibilty and as advised not to replace the hose by anthony the building manager.        

-We turned off the hot water valve for the washing machine and isolated the leak.

-We also advised the tenet of unit 77 to contact there agent in regarding the washing machine hose.

Yes  just the hose from the machine. But I can            t charge the tenant  so I will issue the invoice to the lot owner and you can recoup from the tenant. Or I            ll pass you the plumber            s invoice when I get it and you can see if they would prefer to pay it direct. But I will only give 7 days to do so  as it            s not fair that the plumber doesn            t get paid in a timely manner.

Does that seem fair to you George?

Hi there George 

Hope you            ve been well.

Please see the report below from the plumber for the leaking issue in the garage  which we have found to be coming from unit 77. This was a washing machine hose which is a lot owner issue. So once I get this invoice from the plumber  I will either pay the invoice and charge the lot account  or you can make the payment of the plumbing invoice directly. Please advise what you prefer.

Also  please ensure that the leaking hose is fixed asap. The plumber shut off the hot water supply and it must remain OFF until the repair is made to avoid further damages and charges please.

"Hi George  

Further to our phone conversation earlier today  plumber had advised me earlier after investigations were completed. 

Origin of the leak is confirmed  unit 77 - hot water supply hose of tenants        washing machine . There is no issue/fault with the actual tap.

I suggest you advise (Hillsong Student College accommodation) of the plumbers report  to which they may choose to further        recover costs from the tenant  on behalf        of the landlord. 

Hope that helps!

Attend site to investigate the water within the carpark from the above units of 73 76 77 and 80.

-Arrived onsite and met with the building manager Anthony and began to investigate the water leak within the carpark. 

-We gained access into unit 73 and ran tests within the laundry to find no leak occur into the car park below. 

-We cut a square hole into the common service duct and found water to be dripping down the pipe indicating the leak is occurring higher than unit 73. 

-Located above unit 73 is unit 77. 

-We gained access within unit 77 and investigated under the laundry sink to find large amounts of water on the floor. 

-We tracked the leak to be coming from the hot water washing machine hose.

-We ran all other testings within the unit and found no leaks as the washing machine hose has been leaking for a few weeks as indicated by the tenet. 

-This is an owners responisibilty and as advised not to replace the hose by anthony the building manager. 

-We turned off the hot water valve for the washing machine and isolated the leak.

-We also advised the tenet of unit 77 to contact there agent in regarding the washing machine hose. 

-We advised all other units we will not require access as the leak was found. 

-We covered the hole created within unit 73 with a sticky cover plate for future access. 

-We advised all issues with the building manager while we were onsite. 

Regards 

Michael Warren

"Hi there George 

Hope you            ve been well.

Please see the report below from the plumber for the leaking issue in the garage  which we have found to be coming from unit 77. This was a washing machine hose which is a lot owner issue. So once I get this invoice from the plumber  I will either pay the invoice and charge the lot account  or you can make the payment of the plumbing invoice directly. Please advise what you prefer.

Also  please ensure that the leaking hose is fixed asap. The plumber shut off the hot water supply and it must remain OFF until the repair is made to avoid further damages and charges please.

Warmest Regards

"Hi George 

Thanks         Steve.

        

For 1  maybe the washer issue  can you try to take the washer and wash it and to see how it goes  as the hot water occur when pressure reach to certain level. (You mean washer at end of the water tap? or under the sink somewhere?)

        

2. For toilet seat  will you able to take a photo and I will check with some service provider to see where you can buy a universal one. (I will send you photos and dimensions between the slots)

        

3. For AC leaking  I have arranged an AC technician to have a look but it may be solved by cleaning the filter.         Do you want to have a go and let me know? ( I will try then let you know if still leaks)

Completely untrue. No one has contacted Rochelle or I at all nor have we provided permission for anyone to enter without us here.        

As I said  I've been waiting all morning  and taken time off work to be here. Again  I'm available after 5.30pm tonight if he's able to come then.

For the hot water system  would you please to check:        

1.	Power switch in on position in fuse box
2.	Power switch on the power point which is supplying electricity to HWS has switched on
3.	Gas valve to HWS switched on        
4.	May use another small appliance to test the HWS power point see if it is in working condition
5.	If you went through above and problem still exists  please advise if the HWS itself would work after you turned on hot water in water tap.

Hi Tom 

        

Thanks for your email. We are happy to pay the $128 fee to have
the fob replaced. Will will include this amount in our next rent payment. I
have emailed Gerard about the garage key as per your advice.

        

I also note that we have been without hot water for two days now.
It appears the problem might relate to the gas hot water system because our
stove still works. I have also spoken to our energy provider who stated that
the issue does not relate to them.        

        

Thank you for your help.

David & Rochelle

I did get one quote for the job but I need your help to get the job done effectively and as quick as possible. As per the Contractor we need to switch off the Basement Fire sprinkler system and Smoke detection alarm system for 5 hours on the Monday Morning/Job time due to the fact that the Contractor needs to use the hot water for the cleaning of oil spill which will trigger the alarm in the basement /Fire indicator panel.

Kindly help me out to close the alarm system for some time in the morning so the job can be completed on Monday or Tuesday.

"Hi George 

Hope You are doing well.

Did you get any quotes for the basement car park job?

I did get one quote for the job but I need your help to get the job done effectively and as quick as possible. As per the Contractor we need to switch off the Basement Fire sprinkler system and Smoke detection alarm system for 5 hours on the Monday Morning/Job time due to the fact that the Contractor needs to use the hot water for the cleaning of oil spill which will trigger the alarm in the basement /Fire indicator panel.

Kindly help me out to close the alarm system for some time in the morning so the job can be completed on Monday or Tuesday.

Looking forward to hearing back from you at earliest.

Cheers.

Subject: RE: Unit 21/195-199 William Street  Granville - ensuite shower room blockage & garage door damage.
Importance: High

Hi Reza 

Thank you for your email and photos.

The quickest way to possibly fix the ensuite floor drain blockage issue - we'd recommend using ""Mr Muscle"" which can be purchased from either Coles or Woolworth. 

Then follow the instruction to pour the whole bottle into the toilet bowl and leave it for 30 mins. 

After 30 mins  please keep flushing down ""hot water"" continuously. 

Please kindly update me if the issue still remains. 

We'd not expect to occur any unnecessary cost to you if the blockage is caused        excessive hair accumulation OR in-appropriate item disposal to the toilet.

For the garage door damage  please kindly advise an estimated date & time as the building manager will need to check the CCTV camera for investigation.

In the meantime  the building manager & strata management has been informed and will address the issue shortly.

If both issues remain in a timely manner  please update me to follow up.

Hope the information assists and looking forward to hearing back from you.

We have not hot water in the sinks and shower this morning. I have contacted AGL and they            ve informed there is nothing wrong in their end.

Would you be able to tell us what is happening and when we can expect to have the water supply reinstated?

Thanks

"Dear Residents         

We have spoken with On The Job Plumbing and they have advised there is a faulty 50mm Spring Check valve that has failed and requires replacing.        

They do not carry this type of valve with them and will source the valve first thing in the morning from their plumbing suppliers.         

On The Job Plumbing have carried out temporary repairs so that you will still have hot water  however there is a chance this temporary repair may fail resulting in hot water failure. If this does occur their will be no hot water until the valve is replaced in the morning        

We apologise for any convenience caused.        

        

Kind Regards

"Dear Residents         

        

We are aware there is an issue with the hot water and suspect there is an airlock in the system which is preventing the hot water from circulating.

        

On The Job Plumbing has been contacted and they are on their way to rectify the issue.

        

Kind Regards

"Hi George 

Just found out from Roxanne that the Tradies started the test after they fixed the hose and left afterwards. Roxanne was the only one who stayed while the machine is on test. Then Roxanne        found the error message.        Not them.
They turned it on and did not wait to check if it was working normally. It was a 12 min rinse cycle and they left shortly after they turned on this dishwasher.

Thank you.

Hi Ruby  

        

There could be something go through the filter and block the spigot.         Attached photo is a sample photo. 

        

The tradie will contact you to go back to check the spigot this time and will let us know whether it is the spigot got blocked.

Hi George 

        

The Tradies came for the dishwasher and said we need to speak to you.

        

They have fixed the hose and there            s        no more leak outside.

        

After test of dishwasher  they found        an        error code E4        plus the water inside the bottom of the dishwasher is        not draining properly after their test.        No leaks outside though.         

        

Have attached 2 photos taken today with the error code and dishwasher still not draining water.

        

Let us know if someone is doing the repairs so we can arrange a time.

        

Thank you

Ruby

1.        Yes there was a drip from where I the marks are but not too strong  just small drips.

        

2. The dishwasher            s leak seems from the outside. I didn            t want to pull more as it might get worse. That            s why I just isolated the cold water so the leak stops. Not sure what else to say.

For 1          I am not sure that leaking  that could the seal when installing the joinery.         If there is a leaking  you will notice the water dripping.         Better to keep monitor. 

        

2. Dishwasher   so the leaking starts when you trying to pull dishwasher out ? It the leaking from underneath of the dishwasher or somewhere else?

Hi George 

        

The first photo is under the sink. If you notice there are some marks on the joints between under the counter and under the sink. I just assume it might be due to sealing issue but unsure.

        

The second photo is just inside the dishwasher. I cannot take a photo of the leak as it had been cleaned out and also turned off the cold tap. It started when I tried to run the dishwasher but did not work and just kept on having a sound. Looks like        water was not flowing through the hose. I tried to pull the dishwasher out but started leaking. It might be the hose but also not sure. I took off the connection of dishwasher        plug from the socket just to be sure.

Good morning George 

        

Hope all is well.

        

Are you able to organise someone to check and repair our dishwasher? It is not working at the moment and started to leak so we turned off the cold water to stop the leak. Now we are only using hot water tap in the kitchen basin.

I also noticed there is a small leak  seems it might be        coming from a sealing from the left kitchen sink.        

        

Please let us know when someone can attend so we can try to get someone to be here that schedule.

        

Thank you.

"Hi George 

The Tradies came for the dishwasher and said we need to speak to you.

They have fixed the hose and there            s        no more leak outside.

After test of dishwasher  they found        an        error code E4        plus the water inside the bottom of the dishwasher is        not draining properly after their test.        No leaks outside though.         

Have attached 2 photos taken today with the error code and dishwasher still not draining water.

Let us know if someone is doing the repairs so we can arrange a time.

Thank you

Ruby

Hi George 

1.        Yes there was a drip from where I the marks are but not too strong  just small drips.

2. The dishwasher            s leak seems from the outside. I didn            t want to pull more as it might get worse. That            s why I just isolated the cold water so the leak stops. Not sure what else to say.

Thanks. 

        

For 1          I am not sure that leaking  that could the seal when installing the joinery.         If there is a leaking  you will notice the water dripping.         Better to keep monitor. 

        

2. Dishwasher   so the leaking starts when you trying to pull dishwasher out ? It the leaking from underneath of the dishwasher or somewhere else?

Hi George 

        

The first photo is under the sink. If you notice there are some marks on the joints between under the counter and under the sink. I just assume it might be due to sealing issue but unsure.

        

The second photo is just inside the dishwasher. I cannot take a photo of the leak as it had been cleaned out and also turned off the cold tap. It started when I tried to run the dishwasher but did not work and just kept on having a sound. Looks like        water was not flowing through the hose. I tried to pull the dishwasher out but started leaking. It might be the hose but also not sure. I took off the connection of dishwasher        plug from the socket just to be sure.

Good morning George 

        

Hope all is well.

        

Are you able to organise someone to check and repair our dishwasher? It is not working at the moment and started to leak so we turned off the cold water to stop the leak. Now we are only using hot water tap in the kitchen basin.

I also noticed there is a small leak  seems it might be        coming from a sealing from the left kitchen sink.        

        

Please let us know when someone can attend so we can try to get someone to be here that schedule.

        

Thank you.

"Hi George 

As discussed today  the dishwasher inlet hose is broken which has caused the leaking.

The cost to replace the inlet hose is $170 plus GST.

Please note that if there is any other issues with the dishwasher we will not be able to fix it.         

If you have any questions regarding the above  please do not hesitate to contact me directly.

Hi George 

        

1.        Yes there was a drip from where I the marks are but not too strong  just small drips.

        

2. The dishwasher            s leak seems from the outside. I didn            t want to pull more as it might get worse. That            s why I just isolated the cold water so the leak stops. Not sure what else to say.

Thanks. 

        

For 1          I am not sure that leaking  that could the seal when installing the joinery.         If there is a leaking  you will notice the water dripping.         Better to keep monitor. 

        

2. Dishwasher   so the leaking starts when you trying to pull dishwasher out ? It the leaking from underneath of the dishwasher or somewhere else?

The first photo is under the sink. If you notice there are some marks on the joints between under the counter and under the sink. I just assume it might be due to sealing issue but unsure.

        

The second photo is just inside the dishwasher. I cannot take a photo of the leak as it had been cleaned out and also turned off the cold tap.

Good morning George 

        

Hope all is well.

        

Are you able to organise someone to check and repair our dishwasher? It is not working at the moment and started to leak so we turned off the cold water to stop the leak. Now we are only using hot water tap in the kitchen basin.

I also noticed there is a small leak  seems it might be        coming from a sealing from the left kitchen sink.        

        

Please let us know when someone can attend so we can try to get someone to be here that schedule.

        

Thank you.

You said the below and I am just confused on some points.

Your rent must always be paid two weeks             in advance  paid        three        working days before the due date. It is always easily to forget so we always suggest you to schedule your payment via Bpay from your financial institution. Please note that your payment due day is every        Wednesday per week / fortnight.

Just a question about rent payment. I            m just confused on when to pay?        

is it next Wednesday for the first payment or the one after? And when do I transfer the money  on a Friday then?        

Just confused on the dates of when what is due and I don            t want to make a mistake.

Hi Jasmine  

        

For laundry tap under the sink  please refer to attached photos.

        

I am not able to circle the hot water tap under sink          but circled the cold one  the laundry tap will have water when the circle one has the cap on and turn on if no washing machine. 

        

Almost all residents have washing machine so when connected then turn on the tap under sink  the laundry tap will work.

Hi Sajit  

Thanks for your email. 

Please refer to below and purchase below brand ( Make sure it is for kitchen)( So far this is the best product for unblock the kitchen drainage ) 

Pour whole bottle into the sink and leave for 20 mins then pour down boiled hot water             100 degrees            to see how it goes. 

It is winter time  sometime fat  oil could result slow water drainage.

Subject: Unit 106/2 River Road west - Water draining slow/drain water coming back up

Hi George 

We have noticed in the last few days water is draining slowly from the Kitchen        basin and also on using the Dishwasher some amount of drain water gets pumped back up to the Kitchen basin.

I have opened and checked for blocks below the basin and that looks clear. The issue I think is beyond the flat or otherwise. Please help on the next steps.

Subject: SP98936 - Guidance for Possible Power Outage

Dear Residents 

I hope this email finds you all well.

Many of you may be aware of a power outage notice that has been issued to NSW.

Whilst we hope that Ryde won            t be subject to this power outage  Building Management would like to provide some guidance on what residents should do during a power outage. Whilst the energy providers try to restore power within hours  it is good practice to be prepared for a prolonged period without power. 

Preparing for power outages:

1.	It is recommended to have a 'lights out             kit prepared. This kit should contain LED torches  batteries  candles  a car mobile phone charger and some cash. 
2.	Keep your fridge and freezer closed and minimise opening as this will greatly reduce the length of time items will stay food safe. If you have advance warning of a power outage  consider lowering the temperature of the fridge so food will stay cold for longer afterwards.
3.	Your mobile phone is likely to be a critical device during a power outage and it would be beneficial to have it fully charged. 

If you run low on battery than residents should consider ensuring their vehicle is topped up with fuel in case you have to charge your mobile phone or any other devices you that can be powered by the cigarette lighter adaptor or USB.

During the blackout

If power suddenly goes out  tick these items off your checklist:

*	IMPORTANT - Check the Ausgrid website (https://www.ausgrid.com.au/Outages/Current-Outages) to confirm if it is a widespread power outage
*	Note the time that the power went off
*	Locate your home safety switch to check if it has been tripped (located in the cupboard above your fridge). If it is not a widespread outage  reset the breaker
*	Turn off electrical devices and appliances  especially anything involving heating (for instance  you don't want your oven or iron coming back on if you're not home when the power returns)
*	Unplug your computer and TV  or any other electrical equipment  to avoid damage if there's a power surge
*	Be aware of the danger of fallen power lines if you go outside
*	Keep across the news and emergency updates (on the radio or your mobile)
*	Check on your neighbours or anyone else you know who might need help
*	Keep a single light turned on (so you know when the power has returned)
*	Check that the fire stair doors have been opened to allow access in and out of the building.

For Strata buildings residents should expect the following to occur with Common Property items: 

*	Building security              security devices installed to doors (i.e. swipe reader) will not work. Access will be through the fire stairs; residents should familiarise themselves with their fire stair exit locations.
*	Garage Door              will not open  however there is a manual override that can be done on the gate. Please advise the Building Manager to have this opened.
*	Lift is not working              check that there is no one stuck in the lift. If there is  please note the contact details below to make a call.
*	Fire Systems              the fire panel for the building will lose power after the back up battery loses power. An alert may sound and the fire brigade may attend.
*	No hot water  maybe no cold water              the pump systems will turn off with no power to them. Once power is restored you will notice that the water will come out brown  you will need to run the water for approximately 15 minutes for it to clear.
*	Ventilation fans/air-conditioning              will not operate. These should reset automatically when power is restored.

Hi Arya  

I had look of the attached water usage. 

The highlighted is the hot water usage. Seems like more water used for hot. 

You can see the hot water reading on 21/03/2022 is 172.390 KL ( you can check the current reading in hot water room  it locates in corridor and not locked to see whether the current reading) 

Cold water reading is attached as well. 

<cid:image005.png@01D87B33.94271F10>

Or you can call altogether to double check . 

I think it maybe because of more hot water is used to drive the price up.

Hi George 

Thanks for the email. This doesn't look right as it is double the amount we used to pay for water for the past three years. Do you know how I can follow this up?

"Hi 
We woke up this and realise the hot water system has stopped working. I have checked the fuse box outside and everything seems to powered properly. Can you get someone to look at it urgently because we can't run on cold water. 

I have left the side gate open to gain access into the premises. I won't be back home until 4pm today. Please kindly ensure the hot water system is fixed today because it's winter season.

Hope to hear        from you soon.

"Hot Water Supply Status
Tuesday  31 May 2022 4:03:00 PM               ·        James Nieto in Announcements > Management Announcements 

Dear Residents  

The failed hot water heater has now been replaced and is currently working. It will still take some time for hot water to reach your units as the heater will need to heat up a 240L storage tank. There is still cold water in the hot water lines but us more hot water is used the circulating water will slowly heat back up. 

Further works are scheduled for tomorrow to ensure the required amount of hot water is being supplied to the building. 

I understand the timing is not ideal  given the current drop in temperature. The plumbers are scrambling to ensure the system is brought backup to 100% capacity and is expected to be completed throughout the day tomorrow. 

We ask for your patience with this matter and apologise for the inconveniences caused.

Hi Mohammed  

Hope you are well. 

The subject line dishwasher washer has some issue with hot water. It is on and off for a while and now it stops having hot water again. 

Could it be a water pressure issue ?

Could you advise whether you can go check and provide a free quote?

Dishwasher model: DSF6106X Dishlex

Thanks for your details. Yes  the hot water tap was a bit loose inside the sink and we tightened it. But still there is NO HOT WATER coming to the Dishwasher. 

Please give me a call before you are visiting here. We will be away between 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM today.

Thanks

Hi Sreeni  

Thanks for your email. 

For the bedroom door lock  from the photo you sent  I think it is just loose  once you twist the cover off you can use a screw driver to tighten it up  or if you don            t know how  I may be around the area tomorrow or day after can help you with it; 

For dishwasher hot water  there are two dishwasher taps  one is cold and other one is hot under sink  can you check whether the hot one has been turned off ?

"Hi George. Thanks for your reply. The water heater outside is undercover and is close to the glass door so there            s no way the rain gets that far in.        
But all good if you don            t think it            s a problem. I was just checking with you as I didn            t want to ignore it incase it meant something bad. We still have hot water.        

Thanks

Hi Rachel  

        

It is because of the wind and rain  when it comes with a strong wind  sometime rain will go into the hot water system chamber. 

        

The hot water system is located on the balcony outdoor areas. 

        

I assume you still got hot water and no further action needs to be taken now.

Subject: Hot water system error

        

Hi George 

For a few days now when we turn on the hot water the hot water system in the kitchen beeps and flashes the number 10. I have googled this and it says that there            s an error with the ignition or flame. As I            m not sure what that means or if it            s a warning that something can get worse can we please have someone come and check it out. 
I will provide a picture below. 

Thank you 
Rachel

"I'll check again but note that many things we had sent for example the ceiling paint coming off in bathroom  it's wasn't there in your condition report photos. Similarly many other things were missed out. Now if we clean the ceiling of bathroom  paint will come off for sure. You can compare & better if you come & we can show what we are talking about. You can compare how so many things have been missed. 
I'm just worried that when we leave  existing damage will be tried to put on us.

Since agents tend to look at every nook & corner when tenants        vacate. 

Please note there is a rod missing in one of the cupboards. This house is in very        poor condition compared to 56/118. Every single wall has very big marks & from        rubbing to remove spots. All the walls are discolored. 

Both bathrooms have significant water/moisture damage. Roof paint is coming off in one of the        bedrooms (photo sent earlier). Linen cupboard has mold in the top shelf roof.

I've sent photos for the condition report. i just wanted to add that there are multiple scuff marks on all the walls & moisture & water damage is there on bathroom doors. There is a hair dryer stuck between the railing & metal wall of        balcony. 

There is mold on the sky roof windows walls (very near to the sky roof window) probably        due to constant rains. 

We dont have hot water in the kitchen sink but will check if there is any valve/tap underneath. Dishwasher        has lot of food & mould stuck (photos attached).

There is mold on the sky roof windows walls (very near to the sky roof window) probably        due to constant rains. 

We dont have hot water in the kitchen sink but will check if there is any valve/tap underneath. Dishwasher        has lot of food & mould stuck (photos attached).

I would like to update you that the kitchen mixer has no hot water issue fixed. The existing mixer has some issues and a new mixer has been installed.         Working all good now.        

No further action is required from your end and I will process your rental income.

"Hi George 

We            ve been having some issues with the hot water for the past couple of days. It started off with there being no hot water for the first half of the day (and then being available again in the afternoons) however since yesterday there has been no hot water at all ( no hot water at the moment either). Just to note that there is water coming out when turning the faucet to hot water but the water that is coming is still cold. 

Have you heard anything from the strata company? Are there any works being done or are other units experiencing this issue as well? 

Thank you.

It seems to only be the kitchen.

I will look at the tap when I get home from work. The dishwasher has only stopped filling up since the water pressure has dropped. I clean the filter at least twice a week even every couple of days and have also turned it off and on.

I            ve tried the troubleshooting and it just won            t fill up or cycle.

Is kitchen could water pressure normal ? or only affect kitchen area  not other areas in the unit ? If only in the kitchen  please refer to attached photo  I have circled the part that you can twist off  then you can see the water restrictor  clean it if not working  remove it then put it back on see how it goes.

Thanks for your reply.

This is what Agl stated.             Can you confirm the water meter number and also if it is not ML020388         then confirm with that this meter number is not linked to the property?           

Is ML020388 linked to Unit 14? Surely there            s a hot water meter somewhere

Hi Tarsha  

Thanks for your email.

The gas meter issue has now been rectified. 

With regards to the water meter. There is only one water meter for this building as the water usage is billed under common property through Sydney Water.

Dear Owners & Agents 

We are aware that there is currently no hot water in units 1-12.

We have had a plumber attend urgently today who has advised that there is a fault with the gas meter. We have logged an urgent job with Jemina who will attend within the next 2-3 days.

In the meantime unfortunately there will be no hot water as the gas cannot light the pilot light to the water heater.

We apologize for the inconvenience and will work with Jemina to have this rectified as quickly as possible.

As soon as we have an update all residents will be informed.

Hi George - happy for you to proceed with replacing the hot water system  including replacement of the tray. If possible and not overreaching  could you request HWM replace it all for $900? Just thought it            s worth a try.        

        

Thanks 

Edwin

It just brought to my attention that the hot water kept runing the whole night. No matter how tightly I turned it off  it kept flowing.

Not only the bathroom also the kitchen taps as well.

Hope you are well. Good news  How the water system is working fine and the issue is caused by the flow restriction in the bathroom shower.        

The flow restrictors have been removed and hot water back to normal.        

The total cost is $125.00 INC GST. No further action is required from your end and the invoice will be processed from your rental income.

Hi Margareta 

Hope this email finds you well and safe.        

The subject line tenant just called me about the hot water issue in the unit.
I have advised him to turn off the individual hot water system and turn it back
on. unfortunately  the issue still remains.        

The kitchen and bathroom washing basin tap does not have hot water and the
shower area only have a small amount and very low-pressure hot water.        

I have engaged Hot water maintenance and they advised us if the repair cost
is under $300.00  they will repair it onsite. otherwise  they will provide us a
quote  if you decide not to go ahead  they will only charge 120+ gst. (service
call fee)        

Please advise whether you have any concerns or would like to engage your own
plumber to attend.        

With thanks

Subject: Changing water taps

Hi George

It just brought to my attention that the hot water kept runing the whole night. No matter how tightly I turned it off  it kept flowing.

Not only the bathroom also the kitchen taps as well.

I urgently request the landlord to change water taps to lifting ones. It is the fourth such problem happens in this year and now even worse.

Please refer to the attached videos.

Thanks

Regards

Dora

Hope you are well.        

Long time no talk. The subject line tenant reported to us the common bathroom washing basin tap was faulty  hot water cannot be turned off.         Video attached.        

Kitchen taps have a similar issue.        

I may suggest replacing new taps sets for the kitchen and common bathroom washing basins.        

I have sent some quotes to request out and you also can have some quotes from your service provider then decide which one we should engage.

Hi Margareta 

Hope this email finds you well and safe.        

The subject line tenant just called me about the hot water issue in the unit. I have advised him to turn off the individual hot water system and turn it back on. unfortunately  the issue still remains.        

The kitchen and bathroom washing basin tap does not have hot water and the shower area only have a small amount and very low-pressure hot water.        

I have engaged Hot water maintenance and they advised us if the repair cost is under $300.00  they will repair it onsite. otherwise  they will provide us a quote  if you decide not to go ahead  they will only charge 120+ gst. (service call fee)        

Please advise whether you have any concerns or would like to engage your own plumber to attend.

Hi George
We urgently request the service of a plumber. This morning our bathroom
hot water tap lost control. The water is shooting into the ceiling. We do
not have access to the hot water supply. Also  our bathroom shower tap is
leaking.

Dear George  

        

We are finding some issues in regard to the drainage in both bathrooms of 103/15 Young Rd  Carlingford.         In the first bathroom closest to the front door  the water in the shower is not going down the drain and it is taking a lot of time to do so.

In the main bedroom ensuite  there was dirty water coming up from the bathroom basin which was very unpleasing to see. Four days ago  however  I had poured Domestos down the drain and it has cleared up a little  however  we would like for it to be checked out. Also  the right corner of the ensuite shower is leaking every time we take a shower. 

We would like to see these issues fixed as soon as possible to prevent any contamination and further issues from arising.

Thank you.

Hi George 

My son told me last night that the problem might not be the dryer because it tripped off even without the dryer on. He thinks that he used a hair dryer and heater was on too and it tripped off  so it might be the overall lighting issue. Give me a few days and I will note if it's only        the dryer isse. No point in replacing the dryer if it's not needed. 

Kind regards

Thanks George 

Jimmy is coming        soon. One more thing I noticed is that the kitchen tap is extremely slow and there is no hot water. It gets slightly warm and then goes cold again. It might be just that some        tap is not opened  I tried but couldn't work it out. Can I show Jimmy that too?

Kind regards

Hi George 

I just went to the balcony to check if everything is ok and realised that whole balcony is full of water. Almost 10 cm high water is collected. Looks like the drainage doesn            t work. I hope it doesn            t rain more at night and water seeps in. 

I will check tomorrow morning again but the drainage needs to be looked at I guess.

Hi George 

Looks like there was an error. I set up the direct debit to be deducted the rent from 1/09 because that            s when my rent was due. But looks like I didn            t specify the dates. I will cancel the payment due on 1/09 because now I have paid the rent upto 15/09. That means my next payment is due in 15/09. 

Please confirm this is correct

Hi George 

My son told me last night that the problem might not be the dryer because it tripped off even without the dryer on. He thinks that he used a hair dryer and heater was on too and it tripped off  so it might be the overall lighting issue. Give me a few days and I will note if it's only        the dryer isse. No point in replacing the dryer if it's not needed.

Hi Dora   

Hope you are well too. 

It is could be food waste or fat. 

I suggest you to use boiled hot water and some drainage cleaner as if plumber sent out found out it is blocked by residues rather than plumbing issue  you may liable for the cost . 

With thanks

For all the lights  unfortunately during the tendency it is under tenant            s responsibility to replace  thus you will need to replace the garage light  rangehood light. For external light  I think it should be simple to replace a light bulb  I will not add that into the list and will take care from my end. 

Would you like to take keys from us next week to get rangehood and garage light replaced ?

Hello        George

Thank you for completing the final inspection. I am pleased the cleaning is up to standard.

Regarding Water Usage  will you email me a bill for payment?

The garage light stopped working about 12 months        ago  I don't recall exactly when. The external light near the HWS I never used. I don't recall when the light stopped working in the exhaust hood. The exhaust light cover light fell off when cleaning as we were vacating. Am I required to go back and replace globes and attach the cover?

Please        advise what action is required.

You need to use washing machine to connect cold or hot water tap under laundry sink then turn on .         You will have water running for laundry sink. 

        

Or you can buy caps that can fit into the taps under the sink then turn on the taps  you will have water running for laundry as well.

Good Morning George 

        

Sorry to bother you but would happen to know how to turn the water on to the laundry sink tap? I can see the taps under the sink for the washing machine but cant see a tap to turn the water on for the tap over the sink and currently no water comes out when you turn the tap on :)        

        

Thanks so much

Hello        George

Thank you for completing the final inspection. I am pleased the cleaning is up to standard.

Regarding Water Usage  will you email me a bill for payment?

The garage light stopped working about 12 months        ago  I don't recall exactly when. The external light near the HWS I never used. I don't recall when the light stopped working in the exhaust hood. The exhaust light cover light fell off when cleaning as we were vacating. Am I required to go back and replace globes and attach the cover?

Please        advise what action is required.

1.	The lid of the smoke alarm has fallen off  possibly due to weakened hold because of its age  and was constantly beeping throughout the day and night until the lid fell off and is only hanging by the hinges.                (Please advise whether it is one in the hallway? if so  please send a photo to us  I will arrange a fire inspection company to replace the smoke alarm when the job can be carried out under current lockdown)
2.	The gas stove seems to have issues when turning it on. When one of the hot plates of the stove is turned on  there are sparks seen in the front two hot plates as well. This is quite concerning as we are unsure of whether it is an issue with the gas  and may possibly be a fire concern. (        Please do not worry  this is the design of this type of gas cooktop  the gas ignitors will not cause any safety hazard  it will only light up the flame for the burner that release the gas        )
3.	There is no consistent hot water supply in our apartment. Often when the kitchen sink and bathroom taps are turned on to the hotter levels  there is hot water in the beginning for about 1-2 minutes  then it is followed by consistently cold water. Sometimes the hot water returns  however  this hot water supply is not consistent. There could be an issue with the gas. (        The how water is produced via the hot water system installed on the balcony  based on your description  it is more like water pressure  the how water system only can produce how water when water pressure reach a certain level        During wintertime  the how water may take a bit more time to produce        )

1.	In Bedroom 2 (closest to the front entrance)  the light is dim as it appears there is a dead second light bulb in there. (        Can arrange a service provider to look into it once lockdown ends)
2.	The stoppers in the bathroom sinks in both bathrooms do not fit  with one not popping back out and the other not fitting at all. (        I think you refer to pop-up wastes in the washing basin  these can be addressed after lockdown)

5.	The stoppers in the bathroom sinks in both bathrooms do not fit  with one not popping back out and the other not fitting at all. 

        

Please note these issues in the condition report and address these as soon as possible.

Dear George  

        

Following up on my previous email about the
condition report   I would like to add a few more issues with the current
residence which I did not include in that report.

1.	The lid of the smoke alarm has fallen off  possibly due to weakened hold because of its age  and was constantly beeping throughout the day and night until the lid fell off and is only hanging by the hinges.
2.	The gas stove seems to have issues when turning it on. When one of the hot plates of the stove is turned on  there are sparks seen in the front two hot plates as well. This is quite concerning as we are unsure of whether it is an issue with the gas  and may possibly be a fire concern.
3.	There is no consistent hot water supply in our apartment. Often when the kitchen sink and bathroom taps are turned on to the hotter levels  there is hot water in the beginning for about 1-2 minutes  then it is followed by consistently cold water. Sometimes the hot water returns  however  this hot water supply is not consistent. There could be an issue with the gas. 
4.	In Bedroom 2 (closest to the front entrance)  the light is dim as it appears there is a dead second light bulb in there. 
5.	The stoppers in the bathroom sinks in both bathrooms do not fit  with one not popping back out and the other not fitting at all. 

        

Please note these issues in the condition
report and address these as soon as possible.

Thank you. 

        

Kind regards  

        

James

Please find attached last water usage invoice  it is the same bpay account for your rent payment. 

For all the lights  unfortunately during the tendency it is under tenant            s responsibility to replace  thus you will need to replace the garage light  rangehood light. For external light  I think it should be simple to replace a light bulb  I will not add that into the list and will take care from my end. 

Would you like to take keys from us next week to get rangehood and garage light replaced ?

Hello        George

Thank you for completing the final inspection. I am pleased the cleaning is up to standard.

Regarding Water Usage  will you email me a bill for payment?

The garage light stopped working about 12 months        ago  I don't recall exactly when. The external light near the HWS I never used. I don't recall when the light stopped working in the exhaust hood. The exhaust light cover light fell off when cleaning as we were vacating. Am I required to go back and replace globes and attach the cover?

Please        advise what action is required.

Hope this email finds you well and safe. 

Further to the subject line address outgoing inspection  I can confirm the following:

1. Rent has been paid up to vacating date ( 26/07/2021); 

2. All keys have been returned;

3. Cleaning is up to our standard; 

4. Final water usage from 16/04/2021 to 26/07/2021 (3085.544----3008=77.544*$2.35=$182.22 

Apart from the above  I would like to seek some clarification for the backyard light near Hot water system and one of the garage lights. 

One of the rangehood lights is not working and the cover is broken. ( Both working at the beginning of the tendency ) 

Apart from the above  the property is returned in a clean condition and in line with normal and wear conditions. 

Please let me know if you have any questions for above.

"Hi Henry 

Please find attached a photo of the tap and pipe under the laundry sink.        

The cold water tap for the washing machine is circled in yellow and you may need to get a long washing hose to connect the hot water tap from the wall near the toilet if you would like to use hot water for the washing machine.        

For the washing machine drainage connection  I have circled in yellow and just need to make sure once the outlet pipe from the washing machine is properly connected to the drainage point by using a hose clamp.        

Have a nice weekend.

Hope this email finds you well. 

Further to our discussion  the subject line hot water system cutting in and out the issue may relate to PCB and Wate body  the repair cost is around $650.00 and not guarantee it can be fixed. 

Thus  we suggest replacing a newer model of Rheem 26 with new valves at $1350.00 INC GST (Including labor and material).

The quoted price is in line with the market price and please let me know whether you would like us to go ahead.

Feel free to contact me when you have time.

Hope this email finds you well. 

Further to our discussion  the subject line hot water system cutting in and out the issue may relate to PCB and Wate body  the repair cost is around $650.00 and not guarantee it can be fixed. 

Thus  we suggest replacing a newer model of Rheem 26 with new valves at $1350.00 INC GST (Including labor and material).

The quoted price is in line with the market price and please let me know whether you would like us to go ahead.

We have been incrementally going outside to turn the instantaneous gas off and back on for our hot water to work  at the moment it            s happening every second day to a day that we need to go out and reset it  

Is this item something that a plumber can look at to fix?

Monday 21st June 2021              Common area testing

Tuesday 22nd June 2021              Unit testing for Blocks A and B  Common area testing 

Wednesday 23rd June 2021              Unit testing for Blocks C  D  E  and F.

If you are unavailable for the inspection  please ensure to make alternative arrangements so that access is provided as per above schedule.

        

Note: Return visits attract an additional cost of $100.00 plus GST per unit charged to the individual unit.                 Failure to provide access may delay the issue and lodgment of the Annual Fire Safety Statement  which is an offence to fire safety compliance regulations and will result in heavy council fines.

2. We can't sight to the hot water system in the balcony

3. Toilet roll holder in toilet is loose

3. Ensuite light switch is partially broken and must be fixed (safety hazard) - refer to attached photo;

8. Courtyard needs to be cleaned and mowed. 

9. Blinds in the dining area and living room are not working properly (partially broken).

Hi George 

        

As discussed today  below are a few issues that we have identified in the property that will need to be addressed by the owner as soon as reasonably practicable:

        

1. Dishwasher is giving an error and cannot be used - refer to attached photo;

        

2. Ensuite toilet leaks and as such cannot be used - refer to attached photos;

        

3. Ensuite light switch is partially broken and must be fixed (safety hazard) - refer to attached photo;

        

4. No hot water in the kitchen.

        

5. Downstairs toilet is wobbly.

        

6. Lights in the courtyard on the side of the house are not working.

        

7. Dining room balcony light is not working.

        

8. Courtyard needs to be cleaned and mowed.        

        

9. Blinds in the dining area and living room are not working properly (partially broken).        

        

10. Toilet roll holders in the ensuite and the second bathroom upstairs are broken and need to be replaced as currently unusable.         

        

11. Soap holders in both showers are wobbly (may potentially break at any time under normal use).        

        

Please confirm receipt of this email and provide us with a timeframe for resolving the above issues.        

        

Also  could you please let us know where the NBN port/outlet is located (so that we can connect our modem)?        

        

Please also note the following that have been communicated to Jun at the time of signing the lease:

- both mine and my wife's names are incorrectly spelled in the lease documents; correct names: Abhirup Chakraborty and Larisa-Iulia Deac;

- both our email addresses are incorrect; correct emails: chakrabortya85@gmail.com<mailto:chakrabortya85@gmail.com> and larisa_iulia@yahoo.com<mailto:larisa_iulia@yahoo.com>.

        

We confirmed with Jun that we can pay the rent fortnightly. I hope that is acceptable.

"Hi George 
We have pressed the mute button but only masks the beep for around 12 hours  is there another solution to the beeping problem?

Also one of the lights on the balcony does not work  and we have been told by the previous tenant that it            s not their issue to replace 

Can we get this light fixed as well? 

Thanks

Hi Kim  

Thanks. Yes. I removed the battery as this is an old type of the NBN set up and battery actually will not work on anything. 

Are you sure beeping is from the box ? If so  you can press mute (The blue button underneath )

Hi George 

thank you for your phone call yesterday to help with the dishwasher and hot water 

Since we were there for a couple of hours yesterday Elise and I noticed a beeping coming from the utility closet from the NBN box  from what we could gather the beeping was telling us the battery needs replacing 

Please view the images attached 

Is this something the owner or yourself can replace?

Many thanks

"Hi George 

As discussed today  below are a few issues that we have identified in the property that will need to be addressed by the owner as soon as reasonably practicable:

1. Dishwasher is giving an error and cannot be used - refer to attached photo;

2. Ensuite toilet leaks and as such cannot be used - refer to attached photos;

3. Ensuite light switch is partially broken and must be fixed (safety hazard) - refer to attached photo;

4. No hot water in the kitchen.

5. Downstairs toilet is wobbly.

6. Lights in the courtyard on the side of the house are not working.

7. Dining room balcony light is not working.

8. Courtyard needs to be cleaned and mowed. 

9. Blinds in the dining area and living room are not working properly (partially broken). 

10. Toilet roll holders in the ensuite and the second bathroom upstairs are broken and need to be replaced as currently unusable. 

11. Soap holders in both showers are wobbly (may potentially break at any time under normal use). 

Please confirm receipt of this email and provide us with a timeframe for resolving the above issues. 

Also  could you please let us know where the NBN port/outlet is located (so that we can connect our modem)? 

Please also note the following that have been communicated to Jun at the time of signing the lease:

- both mine and my wife's names are incorrectly spelled in the lease documents; correct names: Abhirup Chakraborty and Larisa-Iulia Deac;

- both our email addresses are incorrect; correct emails: chakrabortya85@gmail.com<mailto:chakrabortya85@gmail.com> and larisa_iulia@yahoo.com<mailto:larisa_iulia@yahoo.com>.

We confirmed with Jun that we can pay the rent fortnightly. I hope that is acceptable. 

Thank you.

"Hi George         

Today pest guy came.

Sandip thought first that building manager may solve this. So he wrote to them and they suggested to contact property manager.        

Not sure if this was needed to include in the condition report.        

Nevertheless pls guide on the next steps for following:        

1. In the laundry space in the Unit  the hot water tap below the basin is very tight/jammed and I am not sure if the washing machine can get hot water. Can you please get someone to check it out and rectify as required

Look forward to hearing from you.

Hi Tony  

Hope you are well. 

We have helped subject line tenant to arrange a plumber to attend the kitchen drainage issue. 

The plumber has advised the following: They had put in almost a bottle of Sulphuric acid and had used a drain cleaner with wire length of plus 7meters to fix the issue.

The issue was resolved back then but I have inspected the property yesterday and if turn on the kitchen water taps  the water will build up after 1 or 2 mins and the pipe under the kitchen sink is all clear. 

I would like to suggest to look into this issue as lower level is a shop front and it could cause a problem in future.

Im happy to send our plumber out there and should the problem be within unit they will pass on invoice to you.

Did you want to see if hot water works before I send out plumber?

Also  I believe I called Sajit to inspect crack / plumbing and he had no idea about the call. Correct me        if I am wrong please.

Hi George  

In terms of the below incident   we had called the plumber whose contact you provided and they fixed the issue.

They had mentioned the block seems to be way down beyond the flat and could also be a strata responsibility. They had put in almost a bottle of Sulphuric acid and had used a drain cleaner with wire length        of plus 7meters to fix the issue.

Lately        we have again noticed the water from the kitchen basin is draining quite        slowly   please see if we can get the strata involved  as I believe this could be a bigger issue.

Hi George

Im happy to send our plumber out there and should the problem be within unit they will pass on invoice to you.

Did you want to see if hot water works before I send out plumber?

Also  I believe I called Sajit to inspect crack / plumbing and he had no idea about the call. Correct me        if I am wrong please.

Thanks

Hi George  

In terms of the below incident   we had called the plumber whose contact you provided and they fixed the issue.

They had mentioned the block seems to be way down beyond the flat and could also be a strata responsibility. They had put in almost a bottle of Sulphuric acid and had used a drain cleaner with wire length        of plus 7meters to fix the issue.

Lately        we have again noticed the water from the kitchen basin is draining quite        slowly   please see if we can get the strata involved  as I believe this could be a bigger issue.

Hi Huiling          

Hope this email finds you well.        

Further to our discussion  Tenant confirmed all gas cooktop are off and no hot water used but still smell strong gas from kitchen. I have advised tenant to turn off the gas for now and confirmed they could not smell gas smell anymore        

I have advised them to keep gas off until plumber has attended and inspected the gas leaking issue.        

Apart from above  they have been informed based on licensed plumber report if there is no gas leak they will be liable for the plumber service call fee .($125.00 INC GST).        

The plumber we engaged is Hot Water Maintenance and service call fee is $125.00 INC GST + Parts+ Labor.                 

I will keep you posted once plumber has attended the issue.        

Have a good night.

"Hi Jasmine  

        

For your
below enquires 

1.	        You can disarm the security alarm by disconnect the battery in the security alarm box.         Please see attached Image 00222          please use unscrew the circled lid  two black screws need to be taken out. 

Then
you can see a block battery have red and black lead  you can disconnect either
one and put the lid back and turn off the power to the wall socket as well;

1.	For the gas smell  please see the image 00040  the water is heated by how water system whenever hot water been turn on as it is located near where the kitchen window is so you may smell some gas when hot water been used.         But please let me know even if no hot water been used but you still smell strong gas . 

With

"Hi George

Repair request for the property at 1/15 Young Road Carlingford NSW 2118

The hot water system is not working. We noticed the issue yesterday at 7pm (it was not working after 12pm yesterday I suspect). On the unit in the balcony  there is no light appearing in the ""ok monitor"" box  and no hot water running from the taps at all.

We have confirmed it is not a gas supply issue as the gas stove operates normally. We did switch off and back on the main power to the unit to restart the hot water system but that did not fix the issue.

Could you please let me know the earliest you can have this fixed. 

Thank you!

Happy New Year as well!

"Hi George

I will be onsite tomorrow around 12pm could you please confirm access to the unit so I can have look?

Please don            t hesitate to contact us for further assistance.

Kind regards

This notice is also
extremely short notice  especially at this time of year. We are due to go on a
family road trip from 5 January so I will contact the electrician to see if he
can do ours early morning.        

        

Thanks for sorting
out the hot water so quickly. We really appreciate how responsive you have been
and how fast you sort things out.        

        

Merry Christmas and
happy New Year to you and all at PIA!        

        

Kind regards

Hi        George

        

Sorry to have to contact you at this time of the year.        

        

Two days ago  the gas hot water control panel in the kitchen started beeping everytime we triggered the hot water. It seems to me there might be a problem with the thermostat. There is still hot water coming through at the moment but would love for a gas technician to come out        and check it out. I'm worried that it will lead to a big gas bill. We've already tried turning it off and on again and it continues to beep. Please see the        attached video.        

        

We will be available most of next week if someone can be organised.        

        

Regards

Tara

Did you want us to book a job in to do so?

Hi        George

        

Sorry to have to contact you at this time of the year.        

        

Two days ago  the gas hot water control panel in the kitchen started beeping everytime we triggered the hot water. It seems to me there might be a problem with the thermostat. There is still hot water coming through at the moment but would love for a gas technician to come out        and check it out. I'm worried that it will lead to a big gas bill. We've already tried turning it off and on again and it continues to beep. Please see the        attached video.        

        

We will be available most of next week if someone can be organised.        

        

Regards

Tara

       »   ¿Hi  George!        

Thanks for your support with my moving out.        

I am sorry for my delay to the                       meeting for returning the keys. It took much more time for cleaning. The carpet cleaner you introduced was so good and he explained how to clean nicely. I tried my best and you can see shiny clean unit! But thinking of time and effort  I will ask the professional to clean the next time as you advised.

As for the stain at the sink became less obvious after the last cleaning. I send you the last photo.        

I also found a small chip at the corner of a wall in the bedroom. I might hit it with a vacuum cleaner or removalist moving furniture. I am not sure. I am sorry         

I also noticed some small damage on the wall just in front of drawers in the Bedroom. You need to look carefully to find them. I attached the photo.        

The corner of the sink in the bathroom is chipped. But that was like that when I moved in and I reported to PIA on the document to move in.        

Other than that  I hope the condition of the unit should be ok.        

One thing I need to ask you to pass on message to the next tenant is the cap of cold water under the sink of the laundry. The carpet cleaner said the rubber is not attached to the cap and cold water will leak under the sink if a tenant use cold water in the sink. He advised not to use the cap and cold water. The next tenant can attach the washing machine on the tub of cold water. Then there is no problem. Until then he/she can use only hot water tub. I remember it happened when I moved in  too.

I left the cap on the sink as the tenant can         see it. Could you pass on this message to him/her. I hope he/she does not want to have a wet carpet on the first day of moving in.

I also left the Downlight you mentioned  air conditioner controller  a metal left when I moved in and a cord left around model area. If you think the latter two are not necessary  please throw them away. As I could not judge  I left them.        

Thank you for changing the light for me!        

I left the instruction booklet of hot water boiler (?) under the sink of the kitchen  I received the other instruction booklets digitally.        

I did not change the password if security machine at the entrance door. So the password is the original.        

        

Thanks again for your help with my living at the unit. You are always helpful and I enjoy living there. I hope the owner will find         a new tenant soon.        

Thank you again and have a lovely day!        

I will send you the photos separately        

Best regards

Mayumi

Hi  George!        

        

As for returning the key  could I come to return the key around 10:30 instead of 2:00 tomorrow?        

        

The carpet cleaner came this morning ( the original plan was in the afternoon) and it is sunny day  which makes carpet dry well by tomorrow morning.        

        

As I will drive off to Central Coast  it is more convenient to drive up there tomorrow. So  I wonder if you can change the time.        

        

Another thing is that I am sorry but I got accidentally stain in the sink of a bathroom two days ago. I tried various things to take off the stains. But it became worse. So  I stop cleaning from there. In the last few days! I am very shocked as I kept the place clean the last 4 years.    °         ­ I am terribly sorry.        

        

I attach the photo. Have a look.        

        

Pls confirm the time tomorrow.        

        

Thank you.

"Hi George 

Thanks for your email.

We have changed the way we operate which had commenced on November 1st 2020.

If you send through a quote request  we will ask that you resend the quote request as a work order with the correct repair limit as per the table below or send through a quote request to replace only. If the appliance repair is above the repair limit  or uneconomical to repair we will still send you through a free quote as per normal. We are just trying to get things done efficiently for you  the landlord and the tenant and this is why we've made these changes.

Let me know if there is anything else I can help you with. 

How would you rate my reply?

Hi Rosemond. 

Thanks for your email. 

Hairs or whatever blocked the drain may in further down position and you may not able to see it as they all been flushed into the drainage pipe. 

You can try draino with boiled hot water combined with a drain snake (Please see attached) 

Or I can introduce a handyman who charge cheaper then a plumber to unblock the drainage.

Hi Rosemond 

Thanks for
your email. 

To
unblock bathroom blocked drainage is
under tenant            s responsibility. 

Please
try to use draino to have a go as it is highly likely blocked by hairs and etc.

Or we can arrange a plumber to unblock but the cost will occur to you.

Hi
George         

We are happy to inform you the hot water problem has been resolved!        

It was a very simple solution; our taps are not designed to work with water
restrictors and as such the hot water was being blocked. The plumber has
rectified the issue and we have hot water throughout our house now.        

I am well impressed with how fast this all happened once I managed to get in
contact with you  thank you for making this happen!        

The last issue we have are the carpets  would you please be able to look into
getting someone out to inspect the moulding? I am happy to make myself
available  just let me know what you will need from me.

Thanks again

Hi George  

        

Thanks again for your time on the phone earlier  I really appreciate how courteous you were in dealing with our case  the fact that you took control and have already started taking steps towards having our issues seen to. 

        

As I explained on the phone I wanted to have a written record of the interaction I unfortunately had with one of your team members  who is also our current property manager  Massimo Facci. 

        

We were contacted by Massimo after a property inspection  where he had noted we had a pet cat  as well as the water damage to the carpet. We were asked to explain why there was damage to the carpet  as well as notified the owners had not been told there would be a pet on the property and saying we would have to seek permission. My partner replied over the weekend explaining we had sought permission for the cat before moving in  and explaining the water damage was an ongoing issue since before we had arrived. We raised our concern that the issue had not been addressed in any way  and now we were growing concerned about mould issues. As well as this my partner  Jasmin  asked about the status of the repair request for the hot water system. This was an issue we had brought up in April with Melvin Toh  our previous property manager.

        

I called Massimo to ask about the above  as he hadn't replied to our e-mails or the messages I had left him to call me. 

        

Before I go on let me point out that my partner and I have reached out to PIA many times for several issues. We have requested gate access codes  which we still haven't received  we have brought up issues with the hot water which have gone ignored until now  and the issues we were assured were being addressed when we moved in  such as the water leaking into the carpets  are only getting worse. When I called up all I wanted to know was when we could expect someone to address these issues. 

        

Unfortunately  Massimo immediately got defensive  initially being argumentative and accusing me of using ""big words to bully him"" and then going on to blame Melvin  our previous property manager for being ""f****g useless"" and telling me I should be angry with him if anyone. I was also told it was not his responsibility  as Melvin was the previous manager  and he was new to the role.

I assured Massimo several times that I was not personally angry at him  or even Melvin  I was only calling to ask when we could expect to start seeing PIA address our concerns  as it had been several months. Massimo only continued to aggravate the situation and stated if it were him ""I would have just moved out months ago"". Regardless of whether that's his professional or personal opinion it was totally unwarranted  and helped my inquiry in no way.

        

I pointed this out and again reminded him that I wasn't being personally aggressive  I didn't want to argue  and I urged him to please just look into the issues and let me know what would be a reasonable timeframe to contact him in regards to our concerns. At this point I was pretty upset  and I can't honestly recount what he said accurately  only that he was swearing  being generally defensive and implying I was the one who had the problem  as I hadn't simply moved out.

        

I clearly remember telling Massimo that I thought he was being very unprofessional and at that point I wanted to talk to someone else  to which I was told ""my boss is a multi-billionaire who would not care about you"". 

        

I again told Massimo I had no vendetta with him  I was only inquiring about the mould in the carpets and the hot water issues. Finally I was told he would look into it  with assurances that ""he loved his job""  but couldn't give me a timeframe on when we would hear back. By this point it was clear to me that I wasn't being heard  I hung up and called right back to lodge a complaint. 

        

George  I must say you are the nicest multi-billionaire I have met. 

        

I am sure you understand why I needed to record this  and while I trust you are now on the case I also need to prepare to defend myself should we have to escalate things further. Thank you again for listening and acting  I appreciate how quickly you organised a plumber to call us and I look forward to working with you to resolve these issues. 

        

Please feel free to call or email us with any questions or concerns.

Hope you are well.        

Tried to call you but not able to reach you  could you check your main switch board in the unit to see any RCD is off?        

If you are not sure  please take a photo of the main switch board that can see all RCD  we can guide you to do a trouble shooting to see how it goes.

Hi
George 

        

The
apartment is currently out of electricity and hot water on one side (both
bathroom            s hot water and bedroom            s electricity is unable to use). However the
one in the kitchen are functioning normally. I believe it is because the
electricity system tripped. As this is a very urgent situation  how should I
solve this as soon as possible? Please reply.

"Hi Quinny 

Good news. The strata has sent the plumber and after a number of visit.        

I have talked the tenant and confirmed the leaking is from the hot water pipe this time  please see attached photos with red highlight.        

It looks like they have replaced part of the down pipe as well.        

We need to arrange carpet cleaner to go in again to extract the water and wash the carpet today or tomorrow.        

I will keep you posted .

Hi 

I attended site this morning having received videos of water flowing across wooden floors at 3am.

I knocked on Unit 40 door  and spoke with the tenants.

I was informed that the hot water tap under the laundry sink had started running water all of a sudden.

I would surmise it has been left in an open position  not turned off.

The tenants said they had tested it  but no water had come out earlier in the night.

There was no washing machine hose connected to the hot water tap  only to the cold.

No signs of water leaking now as the tap has been turned off.

The tenants told me something about a membrane  I am not sure having never heard of it before.

Best to speak to them about this.

It would be good to get in contact with Patrick Saad the strata        manager as well to ensure everything goes smoothly.

If you need any additional information  please let me know.

Regards

Hi Vicki 

At 1600hrs 21/07/2020  a new washing machine was installed into Unit 40/1271-1277 Botany Road Mascot<https://www.google.com/maps/search/Unit+40%2F1271-1277+Botany+Road+Mascot?entry=gmail&amp;source=g>. The Machine was originally installed on the left hand tap which did not work. There was no flow of water at all through the left-hand tap. The machine was then connected to the right hand tap. Even after the hose was disconnected from the left hand tap  we tried to turn the water on  and nothing came out of it  which led us to believe that the tap was faulty and proceeded to turn it completely off and just use the cold water for the machine.We successfully washed two loads of washing using the right-hand tap with no issues and there were no signs of leaking from 1600 - 2359. My partner checked the washing machine area before locking up and going to bed at 0000hrs 22/07/2020. We woke up at 0130 to the fire alarm and the sound of water  we identified that the left-hand side tap was gushing extremely hot water throughout the apartment. I attempted to turn the tap further myself and could not turn it off  I then yelled out to my partner to help as my hands and feet were being burnt by direct hot water from the left hand tap. My partner then attempted to tighten the same tap even further and only managed to move it slightly which stopped the leak  all while burning his own hands and feet. The extent of the leak is unknown outside the apartment  but the Building Manager Darren is aware of the damage. As far as we know one neighbour's apartment was drenched and the emergency exit had water leaking down the stairwell. In this apartment  the water reached our bedroom and up the hallway  soaking the carpet  and our mattress. The floor is currently still wet. Please see attached pictures.

Kind regards 

Tahli Keller and Daniel Green

Hi Sarmad  

I think $26.00 is for the water usage $25.29. 

Because $26.00 is more than $25.29 thus it has not been allocated. 

I can manually allocate  then it will reflect on your ledger.

Hi

Main bathroom exhaust        fan is not working. During this winter time  it is really essential. Otherwise mould will come soon as we don;t have window in the bathrooms. 

As well as some days back I informed that kitchen tap is not working correctly as it is too hard to open and close. A person came to fix the tap issue but didn't replace. Now it is more harder than previous        and it is hard to change from cool water to hot water as well.

Please fix those 2 issues as soon as possible.

Hi George 

Just found out from Roxanne that the Tradies started the test after they fixed the hose and left afterwards. Roxanne was the only one who stayed while the machine is on test. Then Roxanne        found the error message.        Not them.

They turned it on and did not wait to check if it was working normally. It was a 12 min rinse cycle and they left shortly after they turned on this dishwasher.

Thank you.

Hi George 

The Tradies came for the dishwasher and said we need to speak to you.

They have fixed the hose and there            s        no more leak outside.

After test of dishwasher  they found        an        error code E4        plus the water inside the bottom of the dishwasher is        not draining properly after their test.        No leaks outside though. 

Have attached 2 photos taken today with the error code and dishwasher still not draining water.

Let us know if someone is doing the repairs so we can arrange a time.

Thank you

2. The dishwasher            s leak seems from the outside. I didn            t want to pull more as it might get worse. That            s why I just isolated the cold water so the leak stops. Not sure what else to say.

For 1  I am not sure that leaking  that could the seal when installing the joinery. If there is a leaking  you will notice the water dripping. Better to keep monitor. 

2. Dishwasher   so the leaking starts when you trying to pull dishwasher out ? It the leaking from underneath of the dishwasher or somewhere else?

Hi George 

The first photo is under the sink. If you notice there are some marks on the joints between under the counter and under the sink. I just assume it might be due to sealing issue but unsure.

The second photo is just inside the dishwasher. I cannot take a photo of the leak as it had been cleaned out and also turned off the cold tap. It started when I tried to run the dishwasher but did not work and just kept on having a sound. Looks like        water was not flowing through the hose. I tried to pull the dishwasher out but started leaking. It might be the hose but also not sure. I took off the connection of dishwasher        plug from the socket just to be sure.

Good morning George 

Hope all is well.

Are you able to organise someone to check and repair our dishwasher? It is not working at the moment and started to leak so we turned off the cold water to stop the leak. Now we are only using hot water tap in the kitchen basin.

I also noticed there is a small leak  seems it might be        coming from a sealing from the left kitchen sink. 

Please let us know when someone can attend so we can try to get someone to be here that schedule.

Thank you.

"You can try to connect washing machine to hot water tap then see whether it is leaking or not. 

The cap could be not firmly installed back that            s why if you put the cap back turn on the hot tap it will leak.

Hi George  

The hot water faucet in the laundry is not working. Water is leaking. Can you please ask someone to fix it? That is urgent. 

Thanks

Hi George  

All good. Just another inquiry regarding the Internet connection. Should I simply reach out to ""my connect"" to have the internet set up and connected for Unit 41?

Your help in this regard is appreciated.

Hi George 

Just found out from Roxanne that the Tradies started the test after they fixed the hose and left afterwards. Roxanne was the only one who stayed while the machine is on test. Then Roxanne        found the error message.        Not them.

They turned it on and did not wait to check if it was working normally. It was a 12 min rinse cycle and they left shortly after they turned on this dishwasher.

Thank you.

Hi George 

The Tradies came for the dishwasher and said we need to speak to you.

They have fixed the hose and there            s        no more leak outside.

After test of dishwasher  they found        an        error code E4        plus the water inside the bottom of the dishwasher is        not draining properly after their test.        No leaks outside though. 

Have attached 2 photos taken today with the error code and dishwasher still not draining water.

Let us know if someone is doing the repairs so we can arrange a time.

Thank you

Ruby

1.        Yes there was a drip from where I the marks are but not too strong  just small drips.

2. The dishwasher            s leak seems from the outside. I didn            t want to pull more as it might get worse. That            s why I just isolated the cold water so the leak stops. Not sure what else to say.

Thanks. 

For 1  I am not sure that leaking  that could the seal when installing the joinery. If there is a leaking  you will notice the water dripping. Better to keep monitor. 

2. Dishwasher   so the leaking starts when you trying to pull dishwasher out ? It the leaking from underneath of the dishwasher or somewhere else?

Hi George 

The first photo is under the sink. If you notice there are some marks on the joints between under the counter and under the sink. I just assume it might be due to sealing issue but unsure.

The second photo is just inside the dishwasher. I cannot take a photo of the leak as it had been cleaned out and also turned off the cold tap. It started when I tried to run the dishwasher but did not work and just kept on having a sound. Looks like        water was not flowing through the hose. I tried to pull the dishwasher out but started leaking. It might be the hose but also not sure. I took off the connection of dishwasher        plug from the socket just to be sure.

Good morning George 

Hope all is well.

Are you able to organise someone to check and repair our dishwasher? It is not working at the moment and started to leak so we turned off the cold water to stop the leak. Now we are only using hot water tap in the kitchen basin.

I also noticed there is a small leak  seems it might be        coming from a sealing from the left kitchen sink. 

Please let us know when someone can attend so we can try to get someone to be here that schedule.

Thank you.

"Hi Vanessa  

Hope you are well. 

I would like to update you that the new dishwasher inlet hose has been replaced and dishwasher has been set to start the new washing circle but E4 error code occurs. 

I have advised the service provider to check all inlet and outlet hose including spigot to make sure there is nothing wrong with hose connection and drain properly but still E4 error code still occur. 

In this case  this will only need to be attended by professional dishwasher technician and you may can consider to replace the dishwasher as repair cost could be higher or equal to replacement. 

Please let me know whether you would like to have some dishwasher replacement quotes or would like to attend the repair/ replacement from your end. 

With thanks

Hi George 

The first photo is under the sink. If you notice there are some marks on the joints between under the counter and under the sink. I just assume it might be due to sealing issue but unsure.

The second photo is just inside the dishwasher. I cannot take a photo of the leak as it had been cleaned out and also turned off the cold tap. It started when I tried to run the dishwasher but did not work and just kept on having a sound. Looks like        water was not flowing through the hose. I tried to pull the dishwasher out but started leaking. It might be the hose but also not sure. I took off the connection of dishwasher        plug from the socket just to be sure.

Good morning George 

Hope all is well.

Are you able to organise someone to check and repair our dishwasher? It is not working at the moment and started to leak so we turned off the cold water to stop the leak. Now we are only using hot water tap in the kitchen basin.

I also noticed there is a small leak  seems it might be        coming from a sealing from the left kitchen sink. 

Please let us know when someone can attend so we can try to get someone to be here that schedule.

Thank you.

Hi George 

The Tradies came for the dishwasher and said we need to speak to you.

They have fixed the hose and there            s        no more leak outside.

After test of dishwasher  they found        an        error code E4        plus the water inside the bottom of the dishwasher is        not draining properly after their test.        No leaks outside though. 

Have attached 2 photos taken today with the error code and dishwasher still not draining water.

Let us know if someone is doing the repairs so we can arrange a time.

Thank you

Ruby

Hi George 

The first photo is under the sink. If you notice there are some marks on the joints between under the counter and under the sink. I just assume it might be due to sealing issue but unsure.

The second photo is just inside the dishwasher. I cannot take a photo of the leak as it had been cleaned out and also turned off the cold tap. It started when I tried to run the dishwasher but did not work and just kept on having a sound. Looks like        water was not flowing through the hose. I tried to pull the dishwasher out but started leaking. It might be the hose but also not sure. I took off the connection of dishwasher        plug from the socket just to be sure.

Good morning George 

Hope all is well.

Are you able to organise someone to check and repair our dishwasher? It is not working at the moment and started to leak so we turned off the cold water to stop the leak. Now we are only using hot water tap in the kitchen basin.

I also noticed there is a small leak  seems it might be        coming from a sealing from the left kitchen sink. 

Please let us know when someone can attend so we can try to get someone to be here that schedule.

Thank you.

Hi George 

The Tradies came for the dishwasher and said we need to speak to you.

They have fixed the hose and there            s        no more leak outside.

After test of dishwasher  they found        an        error code E4        plus the water inside the bottom of the dishwasher is        not draining properly after their test.        No leaks outside though. 

Have attached 2 photos taken today with the error code and dishwasher still not draining water.

Let us know if someone is doing the repairs so we can arrange a time.

Thank you

Ruby

2. Dishwasher   so the leaking starts when you trying to pull dishwasher out ? It the leaking from underneath of the dishwasher or somewhere else?

Hi George 

As discussed today  the dishwasher inlet hose is broken which has caused the leaking.

The cost to replace the inlet hose is $170 plus GST.

Please note that if there is any other issues with the dishwasher we will not be able to fix it. 

If you have any questions regarding the above  please do not hesitate to contact me directly.

Good morning George 

Hope all is well.

Are you able to organise someone to check and repair our dishwasher? It is not working at the moment and started to leak so we turned off the cold water to stop the leak. Now we are only using hot water tap in the kitchen basin.

I also noticed there is a small leak  seems it might be        coming from a sealing from the left kitchen sink. 

Please let us know when someone can attend so we can try to get someone to be here that schedule.

Thank you.

1.        Yes there was a drip from where I the marks are but not too strong  just small drips.

2. The dishwasher            s leak seems from the outside. I didn            t want to pull more as it might get worse. That            s why I just isolated the cold water so the leak stops. Not sure what else to say.

2. Dishwasher   so the leaking starts when you trying to pull dishwasher out ? It the leaking from underneath of the dishwasher or somewhere else?

Good morning George 

Hope all is well.

Are you able to organise someone to check and repair our dishwasher? It is not working at the moment and started to leak so we turned off the cold water to stop the leak. Now we are only using hot water tap in the kitchen basin.

I also noticed there is a small leak  seems it might be        coming from a sealing from the left kitchen sink. 

Please let us know when someone can attend so we can try to get someone to be here that schedule.

Thank you.

"Hi Vannesa  

Hope you are well. 

Please refer to below and do you want me to arrange someone to check the kitchen sink leaking ? Probably just need to do a re-seal. 

For dishwasher  I am afraid we need to arrange some service provider to check ?

Please let me know your thoughts.

Hi George 

1.        Yes there was a drip from where I the marks are but not too strong  just small drips.

2. The dishwasher            s leak seems from the outside. I didn            t want to pull more as it might get worse. That            s why I just isolated the cold water so the leak stops. Not sure what else to say.

For 1  I am not sure that leaking  that could the seal when installing the joinery. If there is a leaking  you will notice the water dripping. Better to keep monitor. 

2. Dishwasher   so the leaking starts when you trying to pull dishwasher out ? It the leaking from underneath of the dishwasher or somewhere else?

Hi George 

The first photo is under the sink. If you notice there are some marks on the joints between under the counter and under the sink. I just assume it might be due to sealing issue but unsure.

The second photo is just inside the dishwasher. I cannot take a photo of the leak as it had been cleaned out and also turned off the cold tap. It started when I tried to run the dishwasher but did not work and just kept on having a sound. Looks like        water was not flowing through the hose. I tried to pull the dishwasher out but started leaking. It might be the hose but also not sure. I took off the connection of dishwasher        plug from the socket just to be sure.

Hello  George  Si Zhou

The sink in the kitchen does not drain well. How can We fix it? 

And since there was no towel rack in the bathroom since I moved in  I reported it  but it is still not fixed.
We look forward to your answer.

Thank you

"Hi Jasmine  

I can see you so far paid 7 weeks rent to our trust account. 

If 4 weeks lodge to RBO as bond and remaining 3 week will be allocated as rent which bring your rent paid up date to 01/07/2022 due on 02/07/2022.

As long as you allow 2 working days for bank to process the rent to hit our account by due day is all good. For example  you can schedule a fortnightly payment on 29/06/2022. 

With thanks

You said the below and I am just confused on some points. 

*	Rent in advance

Your rent must always be paid two weeks             in advance  paid three        working days before the due date. It is always easily to forget so we always suggest you to schedule your payment via Bpay from your financial institution. Please note that your payment due day is every Wednesday per week / fortnight.

Just a question about rent payment. I            m just confused on when to pay? 

is it next Wednesday for the first payment or the one after? And when do I transfer the money  on a Friday then? 

Just confused on the dates of when what is due and I don            t want to make a mistake. 

Thanks

Hi Jasmine  

For laundry tap under the sink  please refer to attached photos.

I am not able to circle the hot water tap under sink  but circled the cold one  the laundry tap will have water when the circle one has the cap on and turn on if no washing machine. 

Almost all residents have washing machine so when connected then turn on the tap under sink  the laundry tap will work.

"Hi Sajit  

Thanks for your email. 

Please refer to below and purchase below brand ( Make sure it is for kitchen)( So far this is the best product for unblock the kitchen drainage ) 

Pour whole bottle into the sink and leave for 20 mins then pour down boiled hot water             100 degrees            to see how it goes. 

It is winter time  sometime fat  oil could result slow water drainage.

Hi George 

We have noticed in the last few days water is draining slowly from the Kitchen        basin and also on using the Dishwasher some amount of drain water gets pumped back up to the Kitchen basin.

I have opened and checked for blocks below the basin and that looks clear. The issue I think is beyond the flat or otherwise. Please help on the next steps.

Subject: RE: Tenant invoice - Unit 211A/37 Nancarrow Avenue  Ryde NSW 2112 - Arya Sharifian & Elnaz Ghazalibalkhkanlou - Altogether (Flow Systems)
Importance: High

Hi Arya  

I had look of the attached water usage. 

The highlighted is the hot water usage. Seems like more water used for hot. 

You can see the hot water reading on 21/03/2022 is 172.390 KL ( you can check the current reading in hot water room  it locates in corridor and not locked to see whether the current reading) 

Cold water reading is attached as well. 

<cid:image005.png@01D87B33.94271F10>

Or you can call altogether to double check . 

I think it maybe because of more hot water is used to drive the price up.

Hi George 

Thanks for the email. This doesn't look right as it is double the amount we used to pay for water for the past three years. Do you know how I can follow this up?

Hi Fiona  

Just to give you another update. Tenant has gone back to the property from work and I have advised tenant to disconnect the hot water system power from the wall GPO and re-plug in after 5 mins then turn on wall taps to hot let running for a while. 

Now the hot water is restored and I will keep you posted. 

Have a good weekend.

Hi 

We woke up this and realise the hot water system has stopped working. I have checked the fuse box outside and everything seems to powered properly. Can you get someone to look at it urgently because we can't run on cold water. 

I have left the side gate open to gain access into the premises. I won't be back home until 4pm today. Please kindly ensure the hot water system is fixed today because it's winter season.

Hope to hear        from you soon.

So  there is no cheaper option to just to check the dishwasher hot water issue? The reason for this question is the repairing cost is almost equal to a new dishwasher. 

If there are no options and If the vendor is a good one  then please arrange it to be checked.

Hope you are well. 

Further to subject line property dishwasher not heating and bedroom door lock issue. I have visited the unit last week and found the following:

1.	Dishwasher has hot water on and off and it stops having hot water today  it may need to engage a technician to attend; 

The technician we used is from appliance guy and they require a pretty high pre-approval repair limit of $490.00   if under they will repair onsite  otherwise they will not repair and provide quote for replacement; 

Or I can seek for a quote for replacement first and let you know consider;

1.	Bedroom door lock issue; It is a lever set issue  quotes are following:

Alliance maintenance : $150.00 inc gst to repair  if not repairable  $230.00 INC GST to replace with the closest possible matched to existing;

BYS: Option 1 replace door handle $150.00; or $200.00 to replace a privacy lock;

Please kindly advise your thoughts.

For the bedroom door lock  from the photo you sent  I think it is just loose  once you twist the cover off you can use a screw driver to tighten it up  or if you don            t know how  I may be around the area tomorrow or day after can help you with it; 

For dishwasher hot water  there are two dishwasher taps  one is cold and other one is hot under sink  can you check whether the hot one has been turned off ?

Hi Chitra  

Hope you are well. 

Further to subject line property dishwasher not heating and bedroom door lock issue. I have visited the unit last week and found the following:

1.	Dishwasher has hot water on and off and it stops having hot water today  it may need to engage a technician to attend; 

The technician we used is from appliance guy and they require a pretty high pre-approval repair limit of $490.00   if under they will repair onsite  otherwise they will not repair and provide quote for replacement; 

Or I can seek for a quote for replacement first and let you know consider;

1.	Bedroom door lock issue; It is a lever set issue  quotes are following:

Alliance maintenance : $150.00 inc gst to repair  if not repairable  $230.00 INC GST to replace with the closest possible matched to existing;

BYS: Option 1 replace door handle $150.00; or $200.00 to replace a privacy lock;

Please kindly advise your thoughts.

For the bedroom door lock  from the photo you sent  I think it is just loose  once you twist the cover off you can use a screw driver to tighten it up  or if you don            t know how  I may be around the area tomorrow or day after can help you with it; 

For dishwasher hot water  there are two dishwasher taps  one is cold and other one is hot under sink  can you check whether the hot one has been turned off ?

Hi Sreeni  

Thanks for your email. 

For the bedroom door lock  from the photo you sent  I think it is just loose  once you twist the cover off you can use a screw driver to tighten it up  or if you don            t know how  I may be around the area tomorrow or day after can help you with it; 

For dishwasher hot water  there are two dishwasher taps  one is cold and other one is hot under sink  can you check whether the hot one has been turned off ?

"Hi Rachel  

It is because of the wind and rain  when it comes with a strong wind  sometime rain will go into the hot water system chamber. 

The hot water system is located on the balcony outdoor areas. 

I assume you still got hot water and no further action needs to be taken now.

As I            m not sure what that means or if it            s a warning that something can get worse can we please have someone come and check it out. 
I will provide a picture below.

Haven            t seen them for ages so we are enjoying the moment.

I had a call from Gavin the tradie this afternoon he will be back tomorrow  weather permitting  to fix the leak. Apparently Unit 13 was done today.

Hi George

As I do not have the skill set to tackle this problem and nor should I be ask to this repair work as I could damage the Dishwasher.

I believe it should be carried out by a qualified technician that knows why the water is not heating up properly.

I clean the filter on a weekly basis.

Similarly many other things were missed out. Now if we clean the ceiling of bathroom  paint will come off for sure. You can compare & better if you come & we can show what we are talking about. You can compare how so many things have been missed. 

I'm just worried that when we leave  existing damage will be tried to put on us.

Please note there is a rod missing in one of the cupboards. This house is in very        poor condition compared to 56/118. Every single wall has very big marks & from        rubbing to remove spots. All the walls are discolored. 

Both bathrooms have significant water/moisture damage. Roof paint is coming off in one of the        bedrooms (photo sent earlier). Linen cupboard has mold in the top shelf roof.

I've sent photos for the condition report. i just wanted to add that there are multiple scuff marks on all the walls & moisture & water damage is there on bathroom doors. There is a hair dryer stuck between the railing & metal wall of        balcony. 

There is mold on the sky roof windows walls (very near to the sky roof window) probably        due to constant rains. 

We dont have hot water in the kitchen sink but will check if there is any valve/tap underneath. Dishwasher        has lot of food & mould stuck (photos attached).

"Hi Gregory  

Thanks for your email. 

I think re-set the hot water system power will help. 

Please find your hot water system on your balcony wall  remove the cover underneath  you can see the power cord connect to the powerpoint  unplug it then re-plug in after 5 mins. 

Did you try to press              On            of the kitchen hot water display?

Hello        George  

There has been a short blackout in our neighbourhood. The electricity came back except for the hot water. The hot water digital display that is in the kitchen is off and I do not know where its the fuse box is located.

Could you please advise?

Kind regards 

Gregory & Lea.

The subject line tenant reported no hot water in the kitchen and sometimes the kitchen draining slow. 

For no hot water from kitchen mixer  highly likely to be a mixer issue and worst case  replacing $170.00+ GST. 

For kitchen drain slow  I have visited the unit before and uninstall all pipe under the sink  but it does sometimes water drain slow  and not sure what causes it. 

My suggestion is. I can let Sydney Budget Renovation go check the kitchen how water issue if confirmed it is a kitchen mixer issue then replace the mixer. 

In the meanwhile  Sydney Budget Renovation can check the kitchen drainage issue to see whether he can fix it. 

Please advise your thoughts?

Re: Kitchen water/tap

We've communicated about this previously - the hot water  as well as the drainage issues.

I've lived with these issues  but now (1) the flow of both hot and cold water is less than 30% now  ie seems        to have gotten worse (2) tonight  no hot water from the kitchen tap.

(3) drainage issue of the kitchen tubs remains

I apologise for the inconvenience  but the kitchen tap/water issues        seem to be getting worse  and now no hot water. I think valves need to be changed??

I will wait for your advice. Thank you as always for your help.

We've communicated about this previously - the hot water  as well as the drainage issues.

I've lived with these issues  but now (1) the flow of both hot and cold water is less than 30% now  ie seems        to have gotten worse (2) tonight  no hot water from the kitchen tap.

(3) drainage issue of the kitchen tubs remains

I apologise for the inconvenience  but the kitchen tap/water issues        seem to be getting worse  and now no hot water. I think valves need to be changed??

I will wait for your advice. Thank you as always for your help.

Hi George
May I ask for your help to fix water taps in the in both bathrooms. One of 
these taps is the newly installed one but the head handle is falling off and 
we can            t use the cold water in the common bathroom. The old shower cap in 
the lounge suite bathroom was rust and it eventually broke. There is 
presence of droplets of water underneath the kitchen sink. I will forward

In this case  I will need to seek approval from owner arrange a technician to go out.

May I have the serial number of the dishwasher and brand ?

And confirm the dishwasher stops when filling up the water in middle of the washing circle and cannot complete the full circle.

Hey George  

It seems to only be the kitchen.

I will look at the tap when I get home from work. The dishwasher has only stopped filling up since the water pressure has dropped. I clean the filter at least twice a week even every couple of days and have also turned it off and on.

I've tried the troubleshooting and it just won't fill up or cycle.

Hi Teena 

Is kitchen could water pressure normal ? or only affect kitchen area  not other areas in the unit ? If only in the kitchen  please refer to attached photo  I have circled the part that you can twist off  then you can see the water restrictor  clean it if not working  remove it then put it back on see how it goes.

Dishwasher not working  can you advise what exactly the issue   have you tried to clean the filter and turn it off then turn back on. ( Please refer to the manual for more details)

There seems to be an issue with the water pressure in the kitchen of our unit.

HI Teena  

In this case  I will need to seek approval from owner arrange a technician to go out. 

May I have the serial number of the dishwasher and brand ?

And confirm the dishwasher stops when filling up the water in middle of the washing circle and cannot complete the full circle. 

With thanks

Good morning George 

The water pressure is better but the dishwasher is still not cycling            it seems the two aren            t related. I            ve tried all the troubleshooting from the manual and nothing is helping.

Looks like some wrong with the pressure. Give a go to the tap  sometimes that will affect the pressure. 

Let me know how it goes next week. 

Have a good weekend and stay safe.

Hey George  

It seems to only be the kitchen.

I will look at the tap when I get home from work. The dishwasher has only stopped filling up since the water pressure has dropped. I clean the filter at least twice a week even every couple of days and have also turned it off and on.

I            ve tried the troubleshooting and it just won            t fill up or cycle.

Hi Teena  

Is kitchen could water pressure normal ? or only affect kitchen area  not other areas in the unit ? If only in the kitchen  please refer to attached photo  I have circled the part that you can twist off  then you can see the water restrictor  clean it if not working  remove it then put it back on see how it goes. 

Dishwasher not working  can you advise what exactly the issue   have you tried to clean the filter and turn it off then turn back on. ( Please refer to the manual for more details)

Hey George  

There seems to be an issue with the water pressure in the kitchen of our unit.

It's very weak n takes a very long time for the hot water to come through...as a result and I'm not sure why our dishwasher isn't working either...could we please have it looked at.

Thank you

We will appreciate if towel railing  wardrobe door and range hood filters can be replaced/repaired.

Water flow in Wash basin is too slow which leads to significant delay in getting hot water.

Let me know how it goes next week.

Hey George  

It seems to only be the kitchen.

I will look at the tap when I get home from work. The dishwasher has only stopped filling up since the water pressure has dropped. I clean the filter at least twice a week even every couple of days and have also turned it off and on.

I            ve tried the troubleshooting and it just won            t fill up or cycle.

Hi Teena  

Is kitchen could water pressure normal ? or only affect kitchen area  not other areas in the unit ? If only in the kitchen  please refer to attached photo  I have circled the part that you can twist off  then you can see the water restrictor  clean it if not working  remove it then put it back on see how it goes. 

Dishwasher not working  can you advise what exactly the issue   have you tried to clean the filter and turn it off then turn back on. ( Please refer to the manual for more details)

Hey George  

There seems to be an issue with the water pressure in the kitchen of our unit.

It's very weak n takes a very long time for the hot water to come through...as a result and I'm not sure why our dishwasher isn't working either...could we please have it looked at.

Thank you

Hi George 

Thanks for your prompt action.

Just a quick update. I got contacted by the hot water company and was
advised that they will reach out to you again and send you another quote.
From what I understood  they may need to replace the whole water heating
device (the one outside) as apparently it            s an old model. I didn            t quite
understand all the details.

Once their new quote is accepted they will contact me again to book a time
to come over and fix the issue.

Regards

Hi George 

I did as advised. After 10 minutes I plugged it back in and turned on all
the hot water taps and left them for about 5 minutes. No change as in the
water coming out was still cold.

What are the next steps?

Thanks.

Hi George 

We            ve been having some issues with the hot water for the past couple of
days. It started off with there being no hot water for the first half of the
day (and then being available again in the afternoons) however since
yesterday there has been no hot water at all ( no hot water at the moment
either). Just to note that there is water coming out when turning the faucet
to hot water but the water that is coming is still cold.

Have you heard anything from the strata company? Are there any works being
done or are other units experiencing this issue as well?

Thank you.

Hey George  

It seems to only be the kitchen.

I will look at the tap when I get home from work. The dishwasher has only stopped filling up since the water pressure has dropped. I clean the filter at least twice a week even every couple of days and have also turned it off and on.

I            ve tried the troubleshooting and it just won            t fill up or cycle.

Contacting the electrician            s number on strata emergency contact paper was the only thing we could do yesterday as it was urgent happening on a public holiday. 

Now that we know your number  we will make sure to contact you directly if such unexpected things are to happen in the future. 

Regarding the payment  we are still waiting for an invoice from David (the electrician). Should we send it through to you when we receive it?

Dear Owners & Agents 

We are aware that there is currently no hot water in units 1-12.

We have had a plumber attend urgently today who has advised that there is a fault with the gas meter. We have logged an urgent job with Jemina who will attend within the next 2-3 days.

In the meantime unfortunately there will be no hot water as the gas cannot light the pilot light to the water heater.

We apologize for the inconvenience and will work with Jemina to have this rectified as quickly as possible.

As soon as we have an update all residents will be informed.

Hi George 

There is no hot water currently for our unit. Do you know if other units
are having the same problem? Has the Strata company advised of any issues
or maintenance currently underway?

Thanks.

Hi George - happy for you to proceed with replacing the hot water system  including replacement of the tray. If possible and not overreaching  could you request HWM replace it all for $900? Just thought it            s worth a try. 

Thanks

Hi George

It just brought to my attention that the hot water kept runing the whole night. No matter how tightly I turned it off  it kept flowing.

Not only the bathroom also the kitchen taps as well.

I urgently request the landlord to change water taps to lifting ones. It is the fourth such problem happens in this year and now even worse.

Please refer to the attached videos.

I believe Sydney Budget Reno have attended few repairs for Epping Unit previously and had no further problems with their service so I would like them to do the job. Please let me know if you would strongly recommend other service provider from your list. 

Hope this will relieve tenant having trouble turning tabs which was mentioned earlier.

Hope you are well. 

Long time no talk. The subject line tenant reported to us the common bathroom washing basin tap was faulty  hot water cannot be turned off. Video attached. 

Kitchen taps have a similar issue. 

I may suggest replacing new taps sets for the kitchen and common bathroom washing basins. 

I have sent some quotes to request out and you also can have some quotes from your service provider then decide which one we should engage. 

With thanks

"Hi Margareta 

Hope you are well. Good news  How the water system is working fine and the issue is caused by the flow restriction in the bathroom shower.        

The flow restrictors have been removed and hot water back to normal.        

The total cost is $125.00 INC GST. No further action is required from your end and the invoice will be processed from your rental income.        

With thanks

Subject: Unit 101/15 Young Road  Carlingford - How water issue 

        

Hi Margareta 

Hope this email finds you well and safe.        

The subject line tenant just called me about the hot water issue in the unit.
I have advised him to turn off the individual hot water system and turn it back
on. unfortunately  the issue still remains.        

The kitchen and bathroom washing basin tap does not have hot water and the
shower area only have a small amount and very low-pressure hot water.        

I have engaged Hot water maintenance and they advised us if the repair cost
is under $300.00  they will repair it onsite. otherwise  they will provide us a
quote  if you decide not to go ahead  they will only charge 120+ gst. (service
call fee)        

Please advise whether you have any concerns or would like to engage your own
plumber to attend.        

With thanks

It just brought to my attention that the hot water kept runing the whole night. No matter how tightly I turned it off  it kept flowing.

Not only the bathroom also the kitchen taps as well.

I urgently request the landlord to change water taps to lifting ones. It is the fourth such problem happens in this year and now even worse.

Please refer to the attached videos.

Subject: Changing water taps

Hi George

It just brought to my attention that the hot water kept runing the whole night. No matter how tightly I turned it off  it kept flowing.

Not only the bathroom also the kitchen taps as well.

I urgently request the landlord to change water taps to lifting ones. It is the fourth such problem happens in this year and now even worse.

Please refer to the attached videos.

Thanks

Regards

Dora

Hi George 

We need a urgent check of the electrical switchboard. One of the switches on the electrical box is always going off and now it's permanently off. I have tried putting it on back  but it switched off very 3 seconds.

Currently all electrical sockets are not working. No hot water and the garage door is not opening presumably because of this switch that has tripped off. 

Please treat as urgent as we really need got water and the electrical sockets working ASAP today. You can reach me on my mobile for any other clarifications.

Hi Margareta 

Hope this email finds you well and safe. 

The subject line tenant just called me about the hot water issue in the unit. I have advised him to turn off the individual hot water system and turn it back on. unfortunately  the issue still remains. 

The kitchen and bathroom washing basin tap does not have hot water and the shower area only have a small amount and very low-pressure hot water. 

I have engaged Hot water maintenance and they advised us if the repair cost is under $300.00  they will repair it onsite. otherwise  they will provide us a quote  if you decide not to go ahead  they will only charge 120+ gst. (service call fee) 

Please advise whether you have any concerns or would like to engage your own plumber to attend.

Hi George
Thank you for the service of a plumber. The sink tap was fixed. Nonetheless 
the shower tap was attended half way.It is now making a lot of noise when in
use and still leaking on the shower cap. May you advise the plumber to come
back and fix it.

"Hi Rina & Jewel  

Hope this email finds you well. 

The subject line tenant reported to us she could smell gas from her lounge area gas oulet. ( Email correspondences attached) 

We have arranged plumber to inspect the subject line unit and found no gas leaking. 

Plumber advised the smell could from the lower level hot water system and advised me it is normal when it starts working the gas sometime escaped from gas chamber and bring to elsewhere by wind. 

However  unit 33 tenant has concern below:              Therefore  this is a strata issue because the fumes coming out from the heater are combustible         and can cause the whole building to explode.

Hence  the strata is liable for the payment  and rectifying the issue in order to ensure safe premises for the residents in this building. Therefore  please speak to Strata to resolve the issue.           

Hi George  

Please find attached the photo taken by the plumber yesterday. As the plumber has advised on the invoice  the instantaneous gas heater on Unit 14 is most likely the source of

the smell. Therefore  this is a strata issue because the fumes coming out from the heater are combustible         and can cause the whole building to explode.

Hence  the strata is liable for the payment  and rectifying the issue in order to ensure safe premises for the residents in this building. Therefore  please speak to Strata to resolve the issue.

Dear George  

        

We are finding some issues in regard to the drainage in both bathrooms
of 103/15 Young Rd  Carlingford.         In the first bathroom closest to the
front door  the water in the shower is not going down the drain and it is
taking a lot of time to do so.

In the main bedroom ensuite  there was dirty water coming up from the
bathroom basin which was very unpleasing to see. Four days ago  however  I had
poured Domestos down the drain and it has cleared up a little  however  we
would like for it to be checked out. Also  the right corner of the ensuite shower
is leaking every time we take a shower. 

We would like to see these issues fixed as soon as possible to prevent
any contamination and further issues from arising.

Thank you.

        

Kind regards

Hi George 

Hope you are well. Prior to the tenants moving in  I just wanted to update you with a few things re Revesby:

1. I            ve done my best to clean the oven. A lot of the residue has been baked on and is difficult to remove without damaging the oven door. Attached are a few final photos. 

2. The ground floor has also been wiped down and vacuumed. Attached are also some photos.

3. I            ve turned the master circuit breaker back on as the hot water requires electricity. Just want to ensure the tenants have hot water when they move in. 

4. I plan to terminate the current electricity contract on the 11 Sept  the same day of the lease commencement. Can you let the new tenants know to arrange an electricity plan.        The NMI for the electricity meter is 41035188670. If the tenants are interested  the current electricity provider is Origin Energy. 

5. As we now have a tenant  can you arrange management and future payment of the strata and water and council rates from rent collected. I            ve attached previous notices for your reference.

6. I            ve provided a copy of the building by-laws. Can you please forward this for the tenants consideration. 

7. Lastly  there is a building manager on the promises. Should the tenants need to contact him  his details are below. Can you please forward his details to the tenants.

Hi George 

My son told me last night that the problem might not be the dryer because it tripped off even without the dryer on. He thinks that he used a hair dryer and heater was on too and it tripped off  so it might be the overall lighting issue. Give me a few days and I will note if it's only        the dryer isse. No point in replacing the dryer if it's not needed.

Jimmy is coming        soon. One more thing I noticed is that the kitchen tap is extremely slow and there is no hot water. It gets slightly warm and then goes cold again. It might be just that some        tap is not opened  I tried but couldn't work it out. Can I show Jimmy that too?

Hi George 

I just went to the balcony to check if everything is ok and realised that whole balcony is full of water. Almost 10 cm high water is collected. Looks like the drainage doesn            t work. I hope it doesn            t rain more at night and water seeps in. 

I will check tomorrow morning again but the drainage needs to be looked at I guess.

Hi George 

Looks like there was an error. I set up the direct debit to be deducted the rent from 1/09 because that            s when my rent was due. But looks like I didn            t specify the dates. I will cancel the payment due on 1/09 because now I have paid the rent upto 15/09. That means my next payment is due in 15/09. 

Please confirm this is correct

Regards 

Nanda

Hi George 

My son told me last night that the problem might not be the dryer because it tripped off even without the dryer on. He thinks that he used a hair dryer and heater was on too and it tripped off  so it might be the overall lighting issue. Give me a few days and I will note if it's only        the dryer isse. No point in replacing the dryer if it's not needed.

Jimmy is coming        soon. One more thing I noticed is that the kitchen tap is extremely slow and there is no hot water. It gets slightly warm and then goes cold again. It might be just that some        tap is not opened  I tried but couldn't work it out. Can I show Jimmy that too?

Hi George 

I just went to the balcony to check if everything is ok and realised that whole balcony is full of water. Almost 10 cm high water is collected. Looks like the drainage doesn            t work. I hope it doesn            t rain more at night and water seeps in. 

I will check tomorrow morning again but the drainage needs to be looked at I guess.

Hi
George 

I
just went to the balcony to check if everything is ok and realised that whole
balcony is full of water. Almost 10 cm high water is collected. Looks like the
drainage doesn            t work. I hope it doesn            t rain more at night and water seeps
in.        

        

I
will check tomorrow morning again but the drainage needs to be looked at I
guess.        

        

Kind
regards 

Nanda

Hi

Looks
like there was an error. I set up the direct debit to be deducted the rent from
1/09 because that            s when my rent was due. But looks like I didn            t specify the
dates. I will cancel the payment due on 1/09 because now I have paid the rent
upto 15/09. That means my next payment is due in 15/09.        

        

Please
confirm this is correct

Thanks George 

Jimmy is coming        soon. One more thing I noticed is that the kitchen tap is extremely slow and there is no hot water. It gets slightly warm and then goes cold again. It might be just that some        tap is not opened  I tried but couldn't work it out. Can I show Jimmy that too?

Hope you are well. 

Just would like to update you that how water maintenance willing to attend the job at $900.00 inc gst to replace the tank and tray. 

However  the tray was not able to remove as the drainage pipe takes a part of the tray and they have adjusted the price to $875.00 INC GST. 

Existing tray will not affect the using of new how water cylinder. 

No further action required and I will process the invoice from the rental income.

Please find attached last water usage invoice  it is the same bpay account for your rent payment. 

For all the lights  unfortunately during the tendency it is under tenant            s responsibility to replace  thus you will need to replace the garage light  rangehood light. For external light  I think it should be simple to replace a light bulb  I will not add that into the list and will take care from my end. 

Would you like to take keys from us next week to get rangehood and garage light replaced ?

Hello        George

Thank you for completing the final inspection. I am pleased the cleaning is up to standard.

Regarding Water Usage  will you email me a bill for payment?

The garage light stopped working about 12 months        ago  I don't recall exactly when. The external light near the HWS I never used. I don't recall when the light stopped working in the exhaust hood. The exhaust light cover light fell off when cleaning as we were vacating. Am I required to go back and replace globes and attach the cover?

Please        advise what action is required.

Hope this email finds you well and safe. 

Further to the subject line address outgoing inspection  I can confirm the following:

1. Rent has been paid up to vacating date ( 26/07/2021); 

2. All keys have been returned;

3. Cleaning is up to our standard; 

4. Final water usage from 16/04/2021 to 26/07/2021 (3085.544----3008=77.544*$2.35=$182.22 

Apart from the above  I would like to seek some clarification for the backyard light near Hot water system and one of the garage lights. 

One of the rangehood lights is not working and the cover is broken. ( Both working at the beginning of the tendency ) 

Apart from the above  the property is returned in a clean condition and in line with normal and wear conditions. 

Please let me know if you have any questions for above.

Hello George

The garage light and the exhausthood light have been replaced. The exhausthood light cover has been fixed in place.

I am unable to remove the cover of the external light. The screws have become stuck by the weather. 

If this is acceptable to you i will return the keys to you tomorrow.

Hi Craig  

Please find attached last water usage invoice  it is the same bpay account for your rent payment. 

For all the lights  unfortunately during the tendency it is under tenant            s responsibility to replace  thus you will need to replace the garage light  rangehood light. For external light  I think it should be simple to replace a light bulb  I will not add that into the list and will take care from my end. 

Would you like to take keys from us next week to get rangehood and garage light replaced ?

With thanks

Hello        George

Thank you for completing the final inspection. I am pleased the cleaning is up to standard.

Regarding Water Usage  will you email me a bill for payment?

The garage light stopped working about 12 months        ago  I don't recall exactly when. The external light near the HWS I never used. I don't recall when the light stopped working in the exhaust hood. The exhaust light cover light fell off when cleaning as we were vacating. Am I required to go back and replace globes and attach the cover?

Please        advise what action is required.

Regards Craig Barrett

Hi Craig 

Hope this email finds you well and safe. 

Further to the subject line address outgoing inspection  I can confirm the following:

1. Rent has been paid up to vacating date ( 26/07/2021); 

2. All keys have been returned;

3. Cleaning is up to our standard; 

4. Final water usage from 16/04/2021 to 26/07/2021 (3085.544----3008=77.544*$2.35=$182.22 

Apart from the above  I would like to seek some clarification for the backyard light near Hot water system and one of the garage lights. 

One of the rangehood lights is not working and the cover is broken. ( Both working at the beginning of the tendency ) 

Apart from the above  the property is returned in a clean condition and in line with normal and wear conditions. 

Please let me know if you have any questions for above. 

With thanks

Hope you are well.         Sorry it seems that there are some miscommunication between you and Norma.         I think their intention is good and I understand I could be quite stress when moving at this moment.         Thanks !        

I have already advised Onwer the front door issue but due to lockdown we may not able to get it adjusted now  we will arrange a service provider to get door adjusted as long as lockdown ends.         

Btw  hot water tank will be replaced and HWM will contact you soon for a suitable time .

Good morning everyone 

John/Norma if you had approached and informed me yourself        I would have got it done straight away. I am organising a gernie        that will spray it off easily. You would think you would be happy for us repairing the balcony as we all know it would have never been done  having a fully renovated apartment with a balcony        that looks like it has not been touched since it was first built is off putting. As you might know  moving in is stressful        and cant help being loud with all the bulky material and putting packs together  nonetheless        this is now complete. Another issue is about the slamming front door where the struts randomly work  not sure who thats on to fix. Again  thank you for letting me know and we will have the above issues sorted. This has been a lovely welcome to my new unit

Good morning George

        

Would you please arrange for someone to come to our units or talk to the new tenants and get them to clean the white paint off the footpath leading into the units 

and then clean the white paint that has dribbled down the front outside brick work on the balcony.

        

Also please remind them that moving from their unit to other units is disturbing owners. I don            t want more phone calls regarding all of this.

        

Tenants have very little regard for rules around blocks of units owned by other people. Your last tenants (international students) were wonderful.

Hope you are well too. 

It is could be food waste or fat. 

I suggest you to use boiled hot water and some drainage cleaner as if plumber sent out found out it is blocked by residues rather than plumbing issue  you may liable for the cost .

Please find attached last water usage invoice  it is the same bpay account for your rent payment. 

For all the lights  unfortunately during the tendency it is under tenant            s responsibility to replace  thus you will need to replace the garage light  rangehood light. For external light  I think it should be simple to replace a light bulb  I will not add that into the list and will take care from my end. 

Would you like to take keys from us next week to get rangehood and garage light replaced ?

Hello        George

Thank you for completing the final inspection. I am pleased the cleaning is up to standard.

Regarding Water Usage  will you email me a bill for payment?

The garage light stopped working about 12 months        ago  I don't recall exactly when. The external light near the HWS I never used. I don't recall when the light stopped working in the exhaust hood. The exhaust light cover light fell off when cleaning as we were vacating. Am I required to go back and replace globes and attach the cover?

Please        advise what action is required.

Hi James  

Thanks for your email. 

Please refer to the reply highlighted: 

1.	The lid of the smoke alarm has fallen off  possibly due to weakened hold because of its age  and was constantly beeping throughout the day and night until the lid fell off and is only hanging by the hinges. (Please advise whether it is one in the hallway? if so  please send a photo to us  I will arrange a fire inspection company to replace the smoke alarm when the job can be carried out under current lockdown)
2.	The gas stove seems to have issues when turning it on. When one of the hot plates of the stove is turned on  there are sparks seen in the front two hot plates as well. This is quite concerning as we are unsure of whether it is an issue with the gas  and may possibly be a fire concern. ( Please do not worry  this is the design of this type of gas cooktop  the gas ignitors will not cause any safety hazard  it will only light up the flame for the burner that release the gas        )
3.	There is no consistent hot water supply in our apartment. Often when the kitchen sink and bathroom taps are turned on to the hotter levels  there is hot water in the beginning for about 1-2 minutes  then it is followed by consistently cold water. Sometimes the hot water returns  however  this hot water supply is not consistent. There could be an issue with the gas. ( The how water is produced via the hot water system installed on the balcony  based on your description  it is more like water pressure  the how water system only can produce how water when water pressure reach a certain level        During wintertime  the how water may take a bit more time to produce        )

1.	In Bedroom 2 (closest to the front entrance)  the light is dim as it appears there is a dead second light bulb in there. ( Can arrange a service provider to look into it once lockdown ends)
2.	The stoppers in the bathroom sinks in both bathrooms do not fit  with one not popping back out and the other not fitting at all. ( I think you refer to pop-up wastes in the washing basin  these can be addressed after lockdown)

With thanks

Hi Craig  

Please find attached last water usage invoice  it is the same bpay account for your rent payment. 

For all the lights  unfortunately during the tendency it is under tenant            s responsibility to replace  thus you will need to replace the garage light  rangehood light. For external light  I think it should be simple to replace a light bulb  I will not add that into the list and will take care from my end. 

Would you like to take keys from us next week to get rangehood and garage light replaced ?

Hello        George

Thank you for completing the final inspection. I am pleased the cleaning is up to standard.

Regarding Water Usage  will you email me a bill for payment?

The garage light stopped working about 12 months        ago  I don't recall exactly when. The external light near the HWS I never used. I don't recall when the light stopped working in the exhaust hood. The exhaust light cover light fell off when cleaning as we were vacating. Am I required to go back and replace globes and attach the cover?

Please        advise what action is required.

Hi Craig 

Hope this email finds you well and safe. 

Further to the subject line address outgoing inspection  I can confirm the following:

1. Rent has been paid up to vacating date ( 26/07/2021); 

2. All keys have been returned;

3. Cleaning is up to our standard; 

4. Final water usage from 16/04/2021 to 26/07/2021 (3085.544----3008=77.544*$2.35=$182.22 

Apart from the above  I would like to seek some clarification for the backyard light near Hot water system and one of the garage lights.

For all the lights  unfortunately during the tendency it is under tenant            s responsibility to replace  thus you will need to replace the garage light  rangehood light. For external light  I think it should be simple to replace a light bulb  I will not add that into the list and will take care from my end. 

Would you like to take keys from us next week to get rangehood and garage light replaced ?

Hello        George

Thank you for completing the final inspection. I am pleased the cleaning is up to standard.

Regarding Water Usage  will you email me a bill for payment?

The garage light stopped working about 12 months        ago  I don't recall exactly when. The external light near the HWS I never used. I don't recall when the light stopped working in the exhaust hood. The exhaust light cover light fell off when cleaning as we were vacating. Am I required to go back and replace globes and attach the cover?

Please        advise what action is required.

"Hi Henry 

Please find attached a photo of the tap and pipe under the laundry sink.        

The cold water tap for the washing machine is circled in yellow and you may need to get a long washing hose to connect the hot water tap from the wall near the toilet if you would like to use hot water for the washing machine.        

For the washing machine drainage connection  I have circled in yellow and just need to make sure once the outlet pipe from the washing machine is properly connected to the drainage point by using a hose clamp.        

Have a nice weekend.

Hi Richard  

Hope this email finds you well. 

Further to our discussion  the subject line hot water system cutting in and out the issue may relate to PCB and Wate body  the repair cost is around $650.00 and not guarantee it can be fixed. 

Thus  we suggest replacing a newer model of Rheem 26 with new valves at $1350.00 INC GST (Including labor and material).

The quoted price is in line with the market price and please let me know whether you would like us to go ahead.

Hi George 

Hope you are well 

Elise and I have been having some issues with our hot water since we            ve moved into 1/15 Young Rd  Carlingford 

We have been incrementally going outside to turn the instantaneous gas off and back on for our hot water to work  at the moment it            s happening every second day to a day that we need to go out and reset it  

Is this item something that a plumber can look at to fix? 

Also we have a pile of the previous tenants mail and not sure what to do with it 

Many thanks

Dear        Norma Christina Pina & Bruno Eduardo PINA 

Unit 55/40-52 Barina Downs Road

Norwest NSW 2153

Hope this email finds you well. 

Please find below and attached fire inspection notice from managing strata. 

Please find attached the notice to be sent to the residents for the Annual Inspection of Essential Fire Safety Service at the above site. 

Inspection as per the below schedule will be carried out:

Monday 21st June 2021              Common area testing

Tuesday 22nd June 2021              Unit testing for Blocks A and B  Common area testing 

Wednesday 23rd June 2021              Unit testing for Blocks C  D  E  and F. 

Please ensure appointments are made should specific times be required by tenants by emailing cr@dtechengineering.com.au<mailto:cr@dtechengineering.com.au> at least 24 hours before the inspection.

If you are unavailable for the inspection  please ensure to make alternative arrangements so that access is provided as per above schedule.

Note: Return visits attract an additional cost of $100.00 plus GST per unit charged to the individual unit. Failure to provide access may delay the issue and lodgment of the Annual Fire Safety Statement  which is an offence to fire safety compliance regulations and will result in heavy council fines.

A tempering valve        is one of the best ways to ensure people are not harmed or scalded by hot water when it comes out of a faucet. It works as a mixing        tool  as it combines both cold and hot water to correctly produce the required water temperature to be released from a particular outlet.

Hi George 

Please find attached condition report for U48  118 Adderton Road.

We generally agree with the conditions  except for:

1. The balcony door isn't locking. This will be urgent matter to be resolved.

2. We can't sight to the hot water system in the balcony

3. Toilet roll holder in toilet is loose

4 Ensuite shower room door is tight upon closing. We need to lift it up to open it

Other things to note are there are minor stains and scratch marks at various areas. There are also cracks in skirting at various parts around the corner  as well as notable pink stains on the carpet in masterbed room.

The fridge alcove seems to be not fully aligned as well.

If you need any specific photos let us know.

Ian

We have pressed the mute button but only masks the beep for around 12 hours  is there another solution to the beeping problem?

Also one of the lights on the balcony does not work  and we have been told by the previous tenant that it            s not their issue to replace 

Can we get this light fixed as well?

Are you sure beeping is from the box ? If so  you can press mute (The blue button underneath )

Hi George 

thank you for your phone call yesterday to help with the dishwasher and hot water 

Since we were there for a couple of hours yesterday Elise and I noticed a beeping coming from the utility closet from the NBN box  from what we could gather the beeping was telling us the battery needs replacing 

Please view the images attached 

Is this something the owner or yourself can replace?

Many thanks

Kim

Hi George 

As discussed today  below are a few issues that we have identified in the property that will need to be addressed by the owner as soon as reasonably practicable:

1. Dishwasher is giving an error and cannot be used - refer to attached photo;

2. Ensuite toilet leaks and as such cannot be used - refer to attached photos;

3. Ensuite light switch is partially broken and must be fixed (safety hazard) - refer to attached photo;

4. No hot water in the kitchen.

5. Downstairs toilet is wobbly.

6. Lights in the courtyard on the side of the house are not working.

7. Dining room balcony light is not working.

8. Courtyard needs to be cleaned and mowed. 

9. Blinds in the dining area and living room are not working properly (partially broken). 

10. Toilet roll holders in the ensuite and the second bathroom upstairs are broken and need to be replaced as currently unusable. 

11. Soap holders in both showers are wobbly (may potentially break at any time under normal use). 

Please confirm receipt of this email and provide us with a timeframe for resolving the above issues.

Thank you.

Hi George  

Today pest guy came.

Sandip thought first that building manager may solve this. So he wrote to them and they suggested to contact property manager. 

Not sure if this was needed to include in the condition report. 

Nevertheless pls guide on the next steps for following: 

1. In the laundry space in the Unit  the hot water tap below the basin is very tight/jammed and I am not sure if the washing machine can get hot water. Can you please get someone to check it out and rectify as required

Look forward to hearing from you.

"Hi Kris  

Thanks. Will process.

Just would like to clarify  the leaking is from shower screen as its seal failed? 

Or other part of water proofing also failed ? As the water also get into the common hallway outside of the property as well.

With thanks

Hi Tony  

Hope you are well. 

We have helped subject line tenant to arrange a plumber to attend the kitchen drainage issue. 

The plumber has advised the following: They had put in almost a bottle of Sulphuric acid and had used a drain cleaner with wire length of plus 7meters to fix the issue.

The issue was resolved back then but I have inspected the property yesterday and if turn on the kitchen water taps  the water will build up after 1 or 2 mins and the pipe under the kitchen sink is all clear. 

I would like to suggest to look into this issue as lower level is a shop front and it could cause a problem in future.

Hi George

Im happy to send our plumber out there and should the problem be within unit they will pass on invoice to you.

Did you want to see if hot water works before I send out plumber?

Also  I believe I called Sajit to inspect crack / plumbing and he had no idea about the call. Correct me        if I am wrong please.

Thanks

Hi George  

In terms of the below incident   we had called the plumber whose contact you provided and they fixed the issue.

They had mentioned the block seems to be way down beyond the flat and could also be a strata responsibility. They had put in almost a bottle of Sulphuric acid and had used a drain cleaner with wire length        of plus 7meters to fix the issue.

Lately        we have again noticed the water from the kitchen basin is draining quite        slowly   please see if we can get the strata involved  as I believe this could be a bigger issue.

I knocked on the tenants door yesterday with no luck. However did not call. 

Strata has approved sending out a plumber. I will chase him to see the time/date he can attend.

Hope you are well. 

We have helped subject line tenant to arrange a plumber to attend the kitchen drainage issue. 

The plumber has advised the following: They had put in almost a bottle of Sulphuric acid and had used a drain cleaner with wire length of plus 7meters to fix the issue.

The issue was resolved back then but I have inspected the property yesterday and if turn on the kitchen water taps  the water will build up after 1 or 2 mins and the pipe under the kitchen sink is all clear. 

I would like to suggest to look into this issue as lower level is a shop front and it could cause a problem in future.

"Hi Huiling          

Hope this email finds you well.        

Further to our discussion  Tenant confirmed all gas cooktop are off and no hot water used but still smell strong gas from kitchen. I have advised tenant to turn off the gas for now and confirmed they could not smell gas smell anymore        

I have advised them to keep gas off until plumber has attended and inspected the gas leaking issue.        

Apart from above  they have been informed based on licensed plumber report if there is no gas leak they will be liable for the plumber service call fee .($125.00 INC GST).        

The plumber we engaged is Hot Water Maintenance and service call fee is $125.00 INC GST + Parts+ Labor.                 

I will keep you posted once plumber has attended the issue.        

Have a good night.

Hi George  

In terms of the below incident   we had called the plumber whose contact you provided and they fixed the issue.

They had mentioned the block seems to be way down beyond the flat and could also be a strata responsibility. They had put in almost a bottle of Sulphuric acid and had used a drain cleaner with wire length        of plus 7meters to fix the issue.

Lately        we have again noticed the water from the kitchen basin is draining quite        slowly   please see if we can get the strata involved  as I believe this could be a bigger issue.
