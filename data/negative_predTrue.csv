﻿good morning 


Thank you very much for answering. Before signing the new contract we would like to make two requests. 




1. We have never used the air conditioning but with the hot days last weekend we turned it on and it does not work well (it does not cool) sometimes the screen shows an error, we want it to be checked and maintained. 




2. Could you install storage/cages? We had several things in the car parking lot and we had to remove them now we have nowhere to store them.




Thanks a lot

10,tenancy related|other|other|other,maintenance,andy26,"Hi, Andy,




Thanks for reaching out, and I am sorry for the late reply, as this email was hidden. 





I’d like to discuss the recent increase in the weekly rent for the property I am currently renting from you. 





Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for providing a home that is conveniently located near my workplace. I really enjoy living in this house and appreciate the maintenance work you have done.





While I understand that rent may fluctuate, I kindly request you to reconsider the proposed increase of $30 per week. I have noticed some areas of the house that require repairs or maintenance. For instance, there are windows still missing blinds, and some facilities are not functioning properly.





Considering the current condition of the property and the fact that similar properties in the surrounding area are being rented out for $600 per week, I believe it would be fair to address these maintenance concerns and keep recent rent.





I have been a responsible tenant, always taking care of the property as if it were my own. I genuinely value the positive relationship we have built, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement regarding the rent increase and the necessary repairs.




I would greatly appreciate it if you could take my concerns into consideration and reassess the proposed rent increase in light of the maintenance needed.




Thank you for your time and understanding. I look forward to hearing from you soon.




Sincerely,




Jiaqi

RENTAL INCREASE & LEASE RENEWAL

We have been instructed by the landlord of the above property to increase your rent to the above amount and hereby provide you with the required minimum sixty (60) days notice of the increase. 

The rent is being increased to this level taking into account factors such as increases in the landlord's costs over the past year, the current demand for rental accommodation in the area and the length of time you have lived in the property.

Your landlord would also like to offer you a renewed fixed term lease for a further term of 6 months. Note, your rent cannot be increased during a fixed term lease period.

﻿ 
Hi Andy
 
Thank you for the below. Unfortunately, we will not be continuing our lease at 1511/39 Rhodes Street, Hillsdale for two reasons. I am only providing the below as feedback.
1.	Because the rental costs are above our means, we were able to find something larger for a lower rise than what we are currently paying. 
		 
2.	The neighbours in apartment 1510 are awful to live next to; on most weekends, they often have loud parties till the early hours of the morning (6-8am). We've had to knock on their door to request that they quiet down, make several police calls, and send a complaint email to the building manager. Our bedroom is opposite from their living room, so we can hear their loud music, shouting, and dog barking in the early morning hours. They also let the dog run up and down the hallway. Their visitors may be heard shouting and conversing as they go between the building and the hallway. Every time the weekend comes around, they cause us a great deal of anxiety, and I've even had to sleep on the sofa with headphones on to try to block out their noise. Sadly, because of this, even if the rent were affordable, we would not plan to stay. I'm not sure how they have managed to stay in the building for this long, and their landlord needs to give their lease a serious evaluation. If not, I don't see how your landlord will be able to keep tenants in their apartment. 
 
We thank you for all that you have done for us during our short stay here and will be in touch to return the keys. In the meantime I will book our move out with the building manager.
 
Thank you
 
Regards,
Sarah and Leo

Hi Sarah,
Thank you for your email and details.
I am afraid as you may be aware the rental market in Sydney is dramatically increasing.
In addition, the landlord has suffered significant losses and heavy financial pressure from the multiple interest rate increase.
Therefore, the increased amount at the time matched the rental market rate however it appears a slight drop these days.
Please propose a reasonable amount so I can help you to discuss it with the landlord.
Hope the information assists and looking forward to hearing from you.

Hi Andy, 
  
Regarding the recent notification we received regarding the proposed rent increase for our apartment, while I understand the need for adjustments in line with market conditions, I would like to present my case and respectfully request your reconsideration of the proposed increase. I believe there are various compelling reasons to support my request: 
  
1. Excellent Tenant Record: Throughout our tenancy, we have strived to be responsible and reliable tenants. We have consistently paid our rent on time, maintained the property well, and respected all lease terms and community regulations. This track record demonstrates our commitment to being a valuable resident, and I kindly ask you to consider this when assessing the proposed increase. We have been loyal tenants in your property, having resided here for a year and would like to continue staying here as this provides stability and consistency, which can be valuable for both tenants and landlords. Considering we would like to extend our stay, I believe it would be mutually beneficial to maintain a favourable landlord-tenant relationship by revisiting the proposed rent increase. 
  
2. Market Research: I have conducted thorough research on rental rates in the surrounding area, and I discovered that similar properties in this neighbourhood are currently available for rent at rates comparable to our given rent increase (please see images attached). Considering this information, the proposed increase may not align with the current market conditions. I would greatly appreciate it if you could take this into account. 
  
3. Financial Hardship: While I understand the need for rental adjustments, we are currently facing some financial challenges that make the proposed increase burdensome for us. I kindly request your understanding and compassion in this matter. Exploring potential alternatives, such as a more gradual increase or maintaining the current rent for a specified period, would greatly assist us in navigating these difficult circumstances. 
  
I genuinely appreciate your attention and consideration of our situation. As dedicated tenants, we are committed to maintaining a positive relationship and upholding our responsibilities. I kindly request an opportunity to discuss this matter further with you, as I believe open communication can lead to a mutually agreeable solution. 
  
Thank you for your time and understanding. I look forward to discussing this matter further and finding a suitable resolution that benefits both parties. 
  
Regards, 
Sarah Rouse

Hi Wudi,


 


I learned that the strata told the landlord months ago. The building manager Paul advised me that the discussions had been undergoing with the strata and landlords for ~12 months. 



 



These repairs are not only in the common areas of the building but the work requires both of my balcony tiles to be ripped apart and re-done. This is going to be highly disruptive to my day-to-day life, noisy to the extent that it's unbearable. I also got to know from the building manager yesterday (after I took the initiative to talk to them) that they may also have to replace the sliding glass doors in the unit I am living in. Where is the courtesy for the landlord to provide me a reasonable notice for this major construction work that is going to cause havoc in my life?



 



I work 100% from home and this noisy work is highly disruptive and damaging to my ears. Any major work like this requires reasonable notice to be provided so I could have made alternative arrangements. There was no communication or even a  courtesy call/email. 



 



Please, may I request to arrange an alternative accommodation/hotel room for daytime only within a 5 km of radius for me asap as these conditions make the property unliveable? 



 



I am not having a fight with anyone but rather just being reasonable about what is acceptable in this situation.



 



I request you to get in touch with me asap via email, please.



 




Thanks & Regards
Amrik Singh

Dear Jian ZHANG (Landlord) & Wudi Wu (Property management)




I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to address a matter of concern that has arisen in our living situation. I appreciate your attention to the comfort and well-being of your tenants. I am firstly highly disappointed for not having been informed about this noisy construction work. If a major work was scheduled which was in planning for months and months, I find it hard to believe that I was not informed by you or your representative agent. In addition, I was not part of any consultation process either. This work is highly noisy, unbearable noise constant for 6-7 hours per day and from my understanding from the local workers, it is going to continue for about. 3-4. months. This work is highly nosy and is giving me a consistent headache. In addition, as I am working 100% from home, it is having a huge impact on my work ie not being able to hear people in meetings and not being able to concentrate on my work.



 



The loud machinery, hammering, and other construction-related noises are occurring during hours that impact our ability to work, relax, and enjoy our home environment.



 



I need your urgent attention to stop this work and under the principle of natural justice, I need to be brought into the discussion about a suitable time for these works to be carried out. I also got to know from the workers that they are ripping apart both the balconies of the unit I am residing in which will cause further massive disruption to my living. I am requesting you to postpone this work until we reach too a suitable agreement.



 



It is highly unbelievable that I did not get any notice from you or Strata about this work.

Thank you for your time and consideration.



Thanks & Regards
Amrik Singh

Subject: Concerns Regarding Construction Noise [U91 13-19 Seven Hills Road, Baulkham Hills, NSW, 2153]


 



Dear Jian ZHANG (Landlord) & Wudi Wu (Property management)




I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to address a matter of concern that has arisen in our living situation. I appreciate your attention to the comfort and well-being of your tenants. I am firstly highly disappointed for not having been informed about this noisy construction work. If a major work was scheduled which was in planning for months and months, I find it hard to believe that I was not informed by you or your representative agent. In addition, I was not part of any consultation process either. This work is highly noisy, unbearable noise constant for 6-7 hours per day and from my understanding from the local workers, it is going to continue for about. 3-4. months. This work is highly nosy and is giving me a consistent headache. In addition, as I am working 100% from home, it is having a huge impact on my work ie not being able to hear people in meetings and not being able to concentrate on my work.



 



The loud machinery, hammering, and other construction-related noises are occurring during hours that impact our ability to work, relax, and enjoy our home environment.



 



I need your urgent attention to stop this work and under the principle of natural justice, I need to be brought into the discussion about a suitable time for these works to be carried out. I also got to know from the workers that they are ripping apart both the balconies of the unit I am residing in which will cause further massive disruption to my living. I am requesting you to postpone this work until we reach too a suitable agreement.



 



It is highly unbelievable that I did not get any notice from you or Strata about this work.

Thank you for your time and consideration.



Thanks & Regards
Amrik Singh

Hi Andy,



 



Thank you for the information.



 



I checked all the photos of the property. I saw some photos with a red pen, it point out the damage to my property. If I am not wrong, they are my first tenant for this property after the settlment. I understand that they were living their for almost 4 years. I am not trying to ask them to give me back a brand new apartment.



 



Do we need to fix the scratch, little hole, pen writing before our new friends move in? Who is going to pay for the repair fee?



 



Regards,



Jun

As you can see from the houses currently for rent in the vicinity of Elizabeth Crescent do not reflect $600 per week which is a $150 per week increase. This is the Penrith area not Sydney. I have given examples of houses in the direct vicinity of the address. 




I propose $500 per week given what is available in Kingswood which reflect the age and condition of the house. And that the rent was previous increased on 16/02/2023 from $410 10/02/2023. 




 In consideration was the granny flat which has windows directly facing the back of the house losing privacy in a bedroom, the back sunroom and undercover area which is unable to be enjoyed as the granny flat tenant has their bins on the joint fence and the dog uses the grass area and it smells of faeces.

Hi Connie,

Thank you for your email and feedback.

I am afraid as you may be aware the rental market in Sydney is dramatically increased in Sydney + the inflation has significantly affected everyone.

In addition, the landlord is suffering heavy financial pressure from the recent multiple interest rate increate.

Therefore, the increased amount is for matching the rental market rate.

In the meantime, the effective date is still about 2 months ahead so you have sufficient time to consider and plan ahead.

Also, please feel free to propose a reasonable amount so I can discuss it with the landlord accordingly.





Hope the information assists and looking forward to hearing from you.

Dear Andy

 

I would like to propose that the owner consider negotiating the rental increase as I have been a long term tenant; I treat the home as my own and look after it.

 

I have investigated current rentals in the Kingswood area and have found that the increase proposed is in excess of current stock.

 

Examples of similar houses with 3 bedrooms, 1 bath, 1 car space/garage:

 

33 Elizabeth Cres, Kingswood

$470

Similar age of building; same 3 bed, 1 bath, 1 car; split system air con in lounge; rear garage; shed – own block, no granny flat

 

7 Grace St, Kingswood

$500 per week

Brick house; 3 bed, 1 bath, 1 car.  Includes, ceiling fans, updated kitchen, enclosed sunroom; rear shed – own block, no granny flat.

 

6 Cosgrove Cres, Kingswood

$430 per week

Similar age of building; updated kitchen and bathroom; split system air con in lounge; rear shed - own block, no granny flat.

 

27 Jones St, Kingswood

Brick house; own block; split system in lounge; rear shed – own block, no granny flat.

 

11 Smith St, Kingswood

Similar age; car port; ceiling fans; updated kitchen; split system air con in lounge and bedroom; rear garage; own block – no granny flat.

 

Please discuss with the owner.

 

Regards

Connie

Dear Connie,

10 Elizabeth Crescent, Kingswood NSW 2747

RENTAL INCREASE & LEASE RENEWAL

The rent is to be increased to: $600.00 per week, effective 15/02/2024. 

We have been instructed by the landlord of the above property to increase your rent to the above amount and hereby provide you with the required minimum sixty (60) days notice of the increase. 

The rent is being increased to this level taking into account factors such as increases in the landlord's costs over the past year, the current demand for rental accommodation in the area and the length of time you have lived in the property. We believe the increased rent to be in line with current rental market value and fair to both parties. 

Your landlord would also like to offer you a renewed fixed term lease for a further term of 12 months. Note, your rent cannot be increased during a fixed term lease period. To initiate the process in order to renew a fixed term lease, contact your property manager Andy Gu on andygu@pia.com.au<mailto:andygu@pia.com.au> as soon as possible. 

Assuring you of our co-operation at all times. 

 

Yours sincerely,

Thank you for sending unit final condition report.




However, by a quick glance that I have attached 2 examples of photos show the kitchen stove, dishwasher, oven etc. are not clean; and show glass screens & wash basin are not clean.




 In addition, the report shows toilet seat screw are broken which should have been showed in last tenant’s final inspection report and has been repaired in November 2022 according to Wudi’s email confirmation and fees has been charged on my account.




Please review and rectify the report ASAP.

Hi Jamie,





​





Wish you are well.





​





We just noted from Unit 91 owner Amy that you stopped repairs/remedial works at the subject property due to outstanding payments.





​





As you know the property applied for a strata loan which is in progress. We are currently waiting for the drawdown approval. As long as the loan is released to the property's trust account, we must pay your invoices as a priority.





​





Amy advised that the tenant has already left the unit and she has significant financial difficulty due to the mortgage. Considering the situation, it would be much appreciated if you could please kindly keep repairing in Unit 91 at least.











Please kindly advise asap. Many thanks.

















Should you have any other queries, please do not hesitate to contact us. Thank you.

Hi Mingshen,



Thanks for your reply.

We will go ahead to arrange the pest control.

Regarding to the cleaning, would you be able to ask your cleaner to go back and carry out the extra cleaning (especially for the marks/ sticker marks on the wall/ceiling/ balcony glass sliding door) which I have attached the photo for your reference).

We will final your bond money once the additional cleaning has been completed. Thanks.

Dear Fang,







Thank you for your email and for conducting the outgoing inspection. We appreciate your efforts in ensuring the property is well-maintained.







Regarding the pest control service, we agree to proceed with the quoted amount of $90+gst. Please go ahead and schedule the service at your earliest convenience.







In response to your inquiry, we have already arranged for the carpet to be steam cleaned. However, we would like to clarify that the marks on the carpet existed before we moved in, Moreover, because we didn't put a bedstead in the master bedroom during our stay, it won't lead to such traces on the carpet. You can check our previous emails, and we have already sent photos.







Our bank account is:



BSB: 012071



Account Number: 311544435



Account Name: Mingshen Zhong



We hope this clarifies the situation. Please let us know if you require any further information or if there are additional steps we need to take to address the inspection findings.







Thank you for your understanding.







Best regards,







Mingshen Zhong

Hi Wei Xiong, Yingjian Liu & Mingshen Zhong,



Hope this email finds you well.



Just would like you know that the outgoing inspection has been carried out and we have found out the property hasn’t been cleaned properly (especially there are lots of marks on the wall) and also a pest control service will need to be carried out urgently.

Could you please advise who is your cleaner and have you arranged the carpet steam cleaned? You will need to ask the cleaner to go back ASAP.

Regarding to the pest control service, the quotation is $90+gst.

We will also send you more photos of same damages we have inspected within the unit.

We will process your bond claim after 24 hours if we didn't receive any response from you.

Please provide your bank detail. ( BSB, Acc, Acc name ) for your bond return.



Kind regards

Hope you are well.

 

Our tenant of the subject unit reported to us that someone came into their property with a key of the property. Police has been involved.

 

Since you were the previous managing agent and the building manager, can you please confirm whether the previous tenants still hold a key for the unit? Also, can you please advise the procedure of lock replacement as these are registered keys?

I said that someone broke into my apartment, for the footage we can definitely see that this guy was trying too many times to broke into my apartment and he done it. If for some reason he had a key with him, he would use it since the first attempt. 




All the footage is with the police right now too.

Hi Sodnomjamts Tseveendorj,

Please be advised, your rent is over a fortnight over due. Your landlord has suggested proceeding with terminating your lease.

If this is not resolved shortly, and we do not have your commitment to rental payment, we will be terminating your lease on instruction by your landlord.

Your rent is currently 20 days in arrears; paid up to 17/10/2023 and $224.00 credit for the next period from 18/10/2023.

The last payment we've received was $720.00 on 03/11/2023. For your reference, attached is your complete tenancy ledger.

If you’ve submitted any rental payments from 03/11/2023 or after receiving this email, please send through the payment confirmation as a response to clarify the situation.

Otherwise, please submit the required payment of $1,936.00 + $720.00 for the next period (also due for payment) to have your account reconciled and rent paid up for the corresponding period.

Rental payments are required to be processed 3 days prior to the due date as it can take up to 3 days for any electronic payment to be cleared and received.

Please note – your Weekly rental payment $720.00 should be submitted no later than Sunday per week / fortnight.

Once the payment for the above is processed and to avoid this issue in future - ensure your next rental payment is submitted no later than Sunday 12/11/2023, then scheduled regularly thereafter.

Kindly note - rental arrears reminders will reflect on your permanent rental history.

If you have any questions or queries - please respond to this email, we’ll be happy to further explain.

Your landlord appreciates your cooperation.

Owner's Corporation. The Owner's Corporation allows parking in that area for
genuine visitors only.

 

Please find the applicable By-law below.

 

By-Law 2 clearly states:

Vehicles

‘An owner or
occupier of a lot must not park or stand any motor or other vehicle on common
property except with the written approval of the Owner’s Corporation.”

Our office acts as Managing Agent for the above property.

 

Further to our previous letter issued on Friday the 13th
of October, we have been advised that residents are still continuing to park
vehicles in the visitor car spaces at the property. The visitor’s space is
common property and as such parking is not allowed without consent of the
Owner's Corporation. The Owner's Corporation allows parking in that area for
genuine visitors only.

 

Please find the applicable By-law below.

 

By-Law 2 clearly states:

Vehicles

‘An owner or
occupier of a lot must not park or stand any motor or other vehicle on common
property except with the written approval of the Owner’s Corporation.”

 

The following
Number Plates have been reported as continuously parking in theses spaces:

BV5 2XS, XPQ 282, EMD 11D, CM4 8VR, BC3 3UC, CIL 31V, EMB 92H, DVW 63T.

 

If your number plate is shown above please note that
further action may be taken if they are continually found parking in these
spaces. Please ensure residents of your unit park their car either in the
allocated space or off common property i.e. on the street.

 

Please note repeated breaches of the Strata Schemes
Management Act 2015 can result in fines of up to $1100.

*	Introduction to the construction team;
*	Update on the Building Works Rectification Order (BWRO) and rectification works completed to date;
*	Update on future works to be completed, including duration and expected impact on residents;

Dear Owners, Agents and Tenants, 

 

I hope this email finds you well. 

 

I write to bring to your attention a very important
resident information session to be held at 6:00PM on Monday, 13 November 2023. 

 

The information session will be held in the onsite community
room (located from the ground floor, down the rear stairs towards Yattenden
Cres).

 

The purpose of the information session is to provide
residents with information on the ongoing construction at Modena.

 

The topics for discussion at the meeting are as follows:

*	Introduction to the construction team;
*	Update on the Building Works Rectification Order (BWRO) and rectification works completed to date;
*	Update on future works to be completed, including duration and expected impact on residents;
*	Opportunity for residents to ask questions.

 

It is strongly encouraged that all interested parties attend
this meeting to receive updates and ask questions.

 

If you have any questions prior to the meeting, please do
not hesitate to reach out to me.
