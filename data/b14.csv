I would like to accept the further 12 months fixed term lease.

Additionally, could I please advise of an issue with the dish washing machine I have been meaning to bring to your attention for some weeks.Â  The LED panel no longer responds to any buttons being pressed and despite multiple resets, no longer works.Â Â  Could you please attend to this, thanks.

Hi George,

Â 

Thank you for your advice, however it is not the power point that isnât working as I have lights on the panel, it is the panel itself which no longer responds to any button being pressed.Â  Either the panel is faulty or the control module has failed and I need a repairman.

Hi Graham, 

Â 

Thanks for your email.Â  Will send you the lease renewal 2 weeks before the new rent effective date. 

Â 

For dishwasher,Â  could you try whether the dishwasher power point is working , or use a power extension cord to connect from dishwasher from another power point. 

Â 

I also attached theÂ  manual and could you try a trouble shooting and let me know how it goes.

There are few issues that need solving if possible. 

1. The power surges as soon as the clothes dryer is turned on with another appliance. for example, washing machine and dryer at the same time or dryer and heater at the same time. Can it be checked?

2. Master bedroom shower gets flooded while having a shower, that is, the water is draining very slowly. It's not a huge issue but if there is a blockage then it needs repairedÂ before it's completely blocked. 

3. Minor question - the dishwasher power cable comes out from the bottom shelf and the power plug is in the top shelf, do you know how it was connected because its quite short. Is there a particular way to plug in?

Finally, could you please let me know when my rent is due?

Dear Nanda Almeida & Nihal Almeida,

WELCOME TO YOUR NEW HOME!

From all us at PIA, we would like to wish you a warm welcome as a new PIA tenant. Below are some important information about your new home. We hope youâll feel at home with us.

IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR TENANCY

*	Property management contact

For any matters regarding your property and tenancy, kindly contact our property management team by sending an email to georgezhou@pia.com.au<mailto:georgezhou@pia.com.au> and specify your property address in the subject line. 

Email would be most direct form of communicationÂ and ensures a record of all matters for efficient and accurate attention.

*	The condition report (To view photos: Inspection Report Photos<https://inspection.mypia.com.au/web/conditional-report/public-photo/auth/111865/> Password: a67c4664)

You have been supplied two copies of the condition report describing condition of the premises. One copy must be returned to your property manager and one for your personal records. Please inspect the premise thoroughly (consider taking photographs) and complete and return the report within 7 days. 

*	Rent in advance

Your rent must always be paid two weeksâ in advance, paid threeÂ working days before the due date. It is always easily to forget so we always suggest you to schedule your payment via Bpay from your financial institution. Please note that your payment due day is every Monday per week / fortnight.

Bpay reference for your tenancy is: Billder code: 4481; Unique DEFT reference:Â 0043394790 

*	Strata by lawsÂ 85796

If you are living in a strata premise, please ensure you always respect and comply with the by-laws. The tenancy agreement is included with a copy of standard by-laws (refer to the tenancy agreement, clause 56). For copy of the by laws, please click: http://www.pia.com.au/media/upload/filebrowser/pmd/strata_by-laws/sp85796_strata_by-law.pdf

Should you not receive this copy please contact to your property manager directly. 

*	Repairs and Maintenance

When you encounter a maintenance or repair issue to expedite attendance, kindly send an email and accurately describe the issue and perhaps provide a few photosÂ including the unit and surrounding areas.Â If you require assistance due to storm emergencies, please call NSW SES on 132 500.

*	Further information available

If you require further information, please refer to our website, http://www.pia.com.au/en/. Where you'll find a wealth of information here on PIA services, PIA investment opportunities, properties for sell and for rent.

Last but not least, feel free to email us if you have any queries during your tenancy or call our office on 02 9192Â 2828 in the event of urgent matters.

Hi Umang, 

Â 

I may know why you have difficulties of connecting washing machine. 

Â 

Please find attached.Â  I have circled cups in red and you need to take it off then connect to wash machine then turn handle in yellow circle to a position in line with the pine. 

Â 

It may take some strength to remove the cup and you can use some tools. 

Â 

Hope this information assists.

Thanks for arranging dish washing machine installation.

It is just installed.

Also I noticed the technician damaged back part of the cabinet shelf to make way for the plug as can be seen in attached photos. Just for future reference and your information.

Hi Daniel, 

Â 

Hope you are well. 

Â 

The outbreak of COVID-19 does create many issues and currently we have no update from relevant authorities in relation to rent. 

Â 

There may some updates from government soon for those who have difficulties of rent and mortgage. Hopefully some plans can be adapted to counter these issues. 

Â 

Please let us know if you have anything need us to check with owner that we can assist you from that point.

Hi George 

Daniel Carlson from unit 68 11-21 woniora Ave Wahroonga. Just wondering whatâs happening with rent during this world wide economic crisis? My employment isnât far of from being over as my boss owns pubs and hotels. I am in talks tomorrow with my employers, and they have told me banks are freezing mortgages and loans in 48hours. 

Kind regards

Thank you for your advice, however it is not the power point that isnât working as I have lights on the panel, it is the panel itself which no longer responds to any button being pressed.Â  Either the panel is faulty or the control module has failed and I need a repairman.

Hi Graham, 

Â 

Thanks for your email.Â  Will send you the lease renewal 2 weeks before the new rent effective date. 

Â 

For dishwasher,Â  could you try whether the dishwasher power point is working , or use a power extension cord to connect from dishwasher from another power point. 

Â 

I also attached theÂ  manual and could you try a trouble shooting and let me know how it goes.

Dear Graham Howard Lowbridge,

Unit 114A/40-52 Barina Downs Road, Norwest NSW 2153

RENTAL INCREASE & LEASE RENEWAL

The rent is to be increased to: $460.00 per week, effective 29/08/2022. 

We have been instructed by the landlord of the above property to increase your rent to the above amount and hereby provide you with the required minimum sixty (60) days notice of the increase. 

The rent is being increased to this level taking into account factors such as increases in the landlord's costs over the past year, the current demand for rental accommodation in the area and the length of time you have lived in the property. We believe the increased rent to be in line with current rental market value and fair to both parties. 

Your landlord would also like to offer you a renewed fixed term lease for a further term of 12 months. Note, your rent cannot be increased during a fixed term lease period. To initiate the process in order to renew a fixed term lease, contact your property manager George Zhou on georgezhou@pia.com.au<mailto:georgezhou@pia.com.au> as soon as possible. 

Assuring you of our co-operation at all times.

Hi Umang, 

Â 

I may know why you have difficulties of connecting washing machine. 

Â 

Please find attached.Â  I have circled cups in red and you need to take it off then connect to wash machine then turn handle in yellow circle to a position in line with the pine. 

Â 

It may take some strength to remove the cup and you can use some tools. 

Â 

Hope this information assists. 

Â 

With thanks

Dear Graham Howard Lowbridge,

Unit 114A/40-52 Barina Downs Road, Norwest NSW 2153

RENTAL INCREASE & LEASE RENEWAL

The rent is to be increased to: $460.00 per week, effective 29/08/2022. 

We have been instructed by the landlord of the above property to increase your rent to the above amount and hereby provide you with the required minimum sixty (60) days notice of the increase. 

The rent is being increased to this level taking into account factors such as increases in the landlord's costs over the past year, the current demand for rental accommodation in the area and the length of time you have lived in the property. We believe the increased rent to be in line with current rental market value and fair to both parties. 

Your landlord would also like to offer you a renewed fixed term lease for a further term of 12 months. Note, your rent cannot be increased during a fixed term lease period. To initiate the process in order to renew a fixed term lease, contact your property manager George Zhou on georgezhou@pia.com.au<mailto:georgezhou@pia.com.au> as soon as possible. 

Assuring you of our co-operation at all times. 

Yours sincerely,

Additionally, could I please advise of an issue with the dish washing machine I have been meaning to bring to your attention for some weeks. The LED panel no longer responds to any buttons being pressed and despite multiple resets, no longer works. Could you please attend to this, thanks. 

Regards,

Graham Lowbridge

Hi George,

Thank you for your advice, however it is not the power point that isnât working as I have lights on the panel, it is the panel itself which no longer responds to any button being pressed. Either the panel is faulty or the control module has failed and I need a repairman.

Hi Graham, 

Thanks for your email. Will send you the lease renewal 2 weeks before the new rent effective date. 

For dishwasher, could you try whether the dishwasher power point is working , or use a power extension cord to connect from dishwasher from another power point. 

I also attached the manual and could you try a trouble shooting and let me know how it goes.

Hi George,

This situation is so distressing and sickening to wait until Friday!We need urgent repair please!Can you imagine yourself without a dishwasher and a kitchen mixer that is falling part, actually today it fell off!Currently we can only use warm water, no cold water available!

We need this fixed ASAP!We have been waiting long enough.

Just be aware, you will need a professional to fix the kitchen mixer, I have tried to tighten it today but it is hard to reach under the sink, practically impossible for amateurs!

Thanks for your understanding.

Good morning George,

Please find attached condition reports and pictures. I agree with the agent's comments inÂ the report. I have added additional comments that were not covered in the conditional report. Please let me knowÂ if you have any questions.

There are few issues that need solving if possible. 

1. The power surges as soon as the clothes dryer is turned on with another appliance. for example, washing machine and dryer at the same time or dryer and heater at the same time. Can it be checked?

2. Master bedroom shower gets flooded while having a shower, that is, the water is draining very slowly. It's not a huge issue but if there is a blockage then it needs repairedÂ before it's completely blocked. 

3. Minor question - the dishwasher power cable comes out from the bottom shelf and the power plug is in the top shelf, do you know how it was connected because its quite short. Is there a particular way to plug in?

Finally, could you please let me know when my rent is due? 

Kind regards,

Nanda

Hi George,

Hope you're doing well,

This is to inform you that the dish-washingÂ machine at Unit 32, 15 Young road-Carlingford, has stopped working properly.

Seemingly there is a problem in power system of the machine and it turns on but after a couple of seconds stops working . (Brand: Smeg)

Would you please arrange a fix or replacement and advise when it can be done?

As it is a part of in-place furniture, I am assuming that it should be fixed at landlord's cost.

Please reach out on email or my phone number if you have any questions. 

Many thanks in advance

Stay Safe

Hoping you are keeping well. Please note the air-condition machine at the apartment is not working. We changed the batteries in the remote and it is not working still.

Please can you send a repairman to check and repair the unit.

And also, since January the washing machine is making mechanical sound.

Please can you send someone to check and repair both machines.

Hi Chuhan,

Â 

Thanks for your email. 

Have you tried to clean up the bottom or the out water pipe in the dishwasher? We have many similar case of the dishwashers which is mainly resulted by food blockage. 

We can get a technician to come and fix the problem. However, if they find out the cause is due to food blockage, the tenant will be responsible for the repair cost. 

Would you like to try from your side to avoid potential cost from your side?

Dear Mew,

Â 

Thanks for your prompt reply. We have reset the dishwasher by following the manual. It seems that it works fine for now. Please discard the rectifying request we earlier sent to you.

Â 

ï»¿Hello Mew, 

Â 

Thank you for your information.

Â I would like to ask whether you received the email in relation to our request on the manual of the dishwashing machine early this month?

Â 

Can you kindly provide us with the full electric manual then we can make sure we manipulate it correctly, before you send out your tradesman?Â 

Â 

Without the manual we cannot tell whether the issue is with us or in the machine itself.Â 

Â 

Thank you

Â 

Regards

GraceÂ

Hi Chuhan Wu; Qian Sun,

Hope allâs well.

For your update, we have submitted your maintenance request to the landlord with quotations for seeking their consideration and approval.

For your information, once the tradesman attends only to find misuse/damage rather than a fault with the unit/s, youâll be liable for any associated charges.

Thank you for your continuous patience.

Kind regards,

Dear Owners, Agents and Residents,

Â 

I hope this email finds you well.

Â 

Please find attached letter in relation to a Basement Pressure Clean that will commence on the following:

Â 

L1,l-1 & B1 will be completed on Monday 19 October 2020 from 8:30 AM â 4:30 PM

Â 

B2 will be completed on Tuesday 20 October 2020 from 8:30 AM â 4:30 PM

Â 

Please note that if there are any cars that are present on the levels on the given attendance date that has been arranged, the floor space beneath the car will not be attended to. With the high pressure washing machines being used, we are unable to come close to any cars to avoid damaging the paint and wheels, so only the areas around the cars will be services, not the floor space beneath. For this reason is it extremely important that all cars are removed from the area to ensure all floor space is able to be attended to.

Â 

Agents, please ensure you urgently notify your tenants for their information and call if needed.

Â 

Thanking you for your co-operation!

The washing machine of dishes in the kitchen has been reported in the apartment conditions, and no answer from you and the landlord; however, who is responsible to fix it please?Â 

It is not working by 90%; in other words, it is usually suspended and does not work well.Â

Dear Graham Howard Lowbridge,

Unit 114A/40-52 Barina Downs Road, Norwest NSW 2153

RENTAL INCREASE & LEASE RENEWAL

The rent is to be increased to: $460.00 per week, effective 29/08/2022. 

We have been instructed by the landlord of the above property to increase your rent to the above amount and hereby provide you with the required minimum sixty (60) days notice of the increase. 

The rent is being increased to this level taking into account factors such as increases in the landlord's costs over the past year, the current demand for rental accommodation in the area and the length of time you have lived in the property. We believe the increased rent to be in line with current rental market value and fair to both parties. 

Your landlord would also like to offer you a renewed fixed term lease for a further term of 12 months. Note, your rent cannot be increased during a fixed term lease period. To initiate the process in order to renew a fixed term lease, contact your property manager George Zhou on georgezhou@pia.com.au<mailto:georgezhou@pia.com.au> as soon as possible. 

Assuring you of our co-operation at all times. 

Â 

Yours sincerely,

Dear Graham Howard Lowbridge,

Unit 114A/40-52 Barina Downs Road, Norwest NSW 2153

RENTAL INCREASE & LEASE RENEWAL

The rent is to be increased to: $460.00 per week, effective 29/08/2022. 

We have been instructed by the landlord of the above property to increase your rent to the above amount and hereby provide you with the required minimum sixty (60) days notice of the increase. 

The rent is being increased to this level taking into account factors such as increases in the landlord's costs over the past year, the current demand for rental accommodation in the area and the length of time you have lived in the property. We believe the increased rent to be in line with current rental market value and fair to both parties. 

Your landlord would also like to offer you a renewed fixed term lease for a further term of 12 months. Note, your rent cannot be increased during a fixed term lease period. To initiate the process in order to renew a fixed term lease, contact your property manager George Zhou on georgezhou@pia.com.au<mailto:georgezhou@pia.com.au> as soon as possible. 

Assuring you of our co-operation at all times. 

Â 

Yours sincerely, 

George, Si Zhou

Hi Simon,

Thatâs correct. All other items on the circuit (TV, washing machine) function normally for extended periods of time.Â 

Itâs only when dryer runs for 5 mins or more that it trips the circuit breaker and all those appliances then turn off.Â 

Cheers,

Glen

Hi Glen,

Thank you for your email.

Can you please confirm the trip is triggered by the dryer alone?

You also mentioned the repair last year, do you mean this trip happened since last year repair or just recently?

Hi Simon,

Hope you're well.

We've just noticed that our clothes dryer is tripping the circuit breaker.

We had someone out here to repair it last year as it wasn't heating and while it seemed to work when he tested it for 30s or so, it trips the circuit breaker when run for 5mins or so.Â 

No rush but if you could please organise for someone to come and inspect that'd be great.

Cheers,

Glen

HiÂ Simon,
Thanks for your email for renewingÂ the lease but I am happy to renew contract for next one more year but I am not ok to pay 510$. I want to negotiate it up to 480$ for next one year. If you want to know why then the reason are below:-

1. Because in this building their are lots of cockroaches which keeps coming inside my unit even though i do pest control every 4 month paying 300$ every time. It cost me extra 600 for a year.

2. The floor from the kitchen is start cracking for which i have spend extra money to placed a mat and the dish washing machine is taking the space which i cant even use.

3. Their is another unit in same building i inspect with the same facilities at 480$ weekly.

4. Their is always some problem with the elevator lights in the building.

We have been doing our best to keep this unit clean and will do it better but the price you mentioned is bit high. Please speak with the owner and let me know as soon as possible.Thank you.

Dear Mr. SimonÂ 

I appreciate your clear explanation in the last email.Â 

I have paid my part rent Â to Marshall till Jan 11th. Because usually Â Marshall pays the rent to your account.Â  Due to a relationship breakdown I no longer have access to the apartment since Dec 28th 2020 because my keys were also taken.

For the balance you mentioned in your email, my plan is as the following. I paid Marshall $1040 (50% share of the Rental Bond), and he transferred the total bond amount to Fair Trading from his bank account. I would like to use my bond to pay my portion which I owe you till Jan 11th and also half of the professional cleaning fee which doesnât matter who will arrange it .Â The Police advised me not to communicate with Marshall from Dec 31st 2020. So I am not able to find a joint solution with Marshall.Â I have no any money left now.Â 

Also, I still have some rental furniture (a fridge, a washing machine and a queens bed) in the apartment. They were at a good condition on the day I left. I asked the rental company to contact with Marshall directly to collect them back before Jan 11th. I have not heard any further information yet. Â If Marshall does not cooperate with the rental company, could you please arrange access for them ?

I apologise to you for all the inconvenience we caused.Â  It is just out of my control.Â 

I appreciate your effort and help again.Â

If we can show that these receipts have been made, then this will show that the tenant was in arrears by only 12 days at the beginning of the policy.

Dear Owners, Agents and Residents,

I hope this email finds you well.

Please find attached letter in relation to a Basement Pressure Clean that will commence on the following:

L1,l-1 & B1 will be completed on Monday 19 October 2020 from 8:30 AM â 4:30 PM

B2 will be completed on Tuesday 20 October 2020 from 8:30 AM â 4:30 PM

Please note that if there are any cars that are present on the levels on the given attendance date that has been arranged, the floor space beneath the car will not be attended to. With the high pressure washing machines being used, we are unable to come close to any cars to avoid damaging the paint and wheels, so only the areas around the cars will be services, not the floor space beneath. For this reason is it extremely important that all cars are removed from the area to ensure all floor space is able to be attended to.

Agents, please ensure you urgently notify your tenants for their information and call if needed.

Thanking you for your co-operation!

The technician came yesterday and solved the issues with the stovetop and the washing machine.

For the stovetop, it seemed to just be wear and tear on the igniter switches causing them to stick, thus leading to the issue.

For the washing machine, it seems that somehow a hairpin had gotten lodged in the drain pump and caused it to stop functioning properly. As none of usÂ own hairpins, we are under the impression that it was left over from previous tenants and just recently got lodged in the drain pump. The technician that came to fix it also thought this was the most likely cause. Thankfully it didn't seem to cause any serious damage to the drain pump and it is back to functioning normally.

Thank you for arranging to have someone come and fix these issues promptly.

Thanks,

Wes

Thank you for your email.

The washing machine is left by the previous tenant and the landlord is not going to do anything for the washing machine.

Should you not need the washing machine anymore, you can put it into the storage or throw it away.

Greetings for the new year!

I am writing to report an issue with our dishwasher.

The machine has been idle ever since we moved in due to our very infrequent cooking and few utensils used. We used it for the first time last Sunday, and we found there was wastewater undrainedÂ at the bottom of the machine after the cycle. Error messages delivered by the LED flashing indicated the same issue (E6. Water pump-out malfunction: The appliance does not pump out the water or does not do so correctly. Check that the drain hose is not kinked or crushed and that the siphon and filter are not fouled. If the problem persists, contact the after-sales service). 

Therefore, we don't know what caused the drain hose or the siphon issue. Or simply because of the design of the outlet prevented the water from coming out, as the outlet is significantly higher than the washing machine draining spot (my speculation only).

We can ensure that all the solid waste thoroughly removed before all the dishes were placed into the dishwasher. And we have checked the filter underneath appeared very clean even after our use. Unfortunately, we were unable to prove this condition of the dishwasher prior to our usage, or even before we moved in. However, while I am aware that the implication of the tick on the condition report, there is nothing dodgy regarding my word of what happened. You are welcome to inspect/investigate.

Could you please kindly suggest, what options do I have to solve this issue?

Thank you!

Regards,

Zhenbang

Hi Simon,

ThankingÂ you for coming back to me. Sorry for missing your call earlier also as I was in a meeting at work. I'm surprisedÂ to hear this as the requested photos and videos were sent last Wednesday evening in three separate emails - the same day they were requested. I've re-sent those emails and am attaching the emails and video to this email also. Please confirm receipt.

We can confirm the power point is working - it's being used for theÂ washing machine and for other appliances. As you will see in the video, there is power running to the unit but it makes a sound but doesn't run.

Thanks,

Anthony.

Hi Simon,

Thanking you for coming back to me. Sorry for missing your call earlier also as I was in a meeting at work. I'm surprised to hear this as the requested photos and videos were sent last Wednesday evening in three separate emails - the same day they were requested. I've re-sent those emails and am attaching the emails and video to this email also. Please confirm receipt.

Hi Anthony,

Thank you for your email.

As I haven't received the requested photos of the serial number, can you please send through so we can help to contact the manufacturer?

In addition, please also let me know if the powerpoint connected to the dryer is working fine. As sometimes, it is the powerpoint issue rather than dryer.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Hi Daniel & Anthony,

Thank you for your email.

We can definitely assist you to report this issue to your landlord. First, I will need the following information from you:

*	Photo of the dryer's model number and serial number tag;

Once received, we will discuss this matter with your landlord.

Hi Simon,

Hoping youâre well. We have attempted to use the dryer for the first time after fully moving in over the weekend, however it appears to be broken. 

At first it wouldnât start at all, however, after troubleshooting online, cleaning out the lint filter and resetting the machine it did operate for a short time. After this, it simply doesnât start no matter what we try. 

The lease agreement states to contact you first to arrange for a possible repair before booking anyone ourselves. Please let us know how youâd like to proceed in this case. 

Many thanks,

Anthony & Daniel

Hi Nasser,

Thank you for your email.

If the dishwasher doesn't have any power, please kindly test the powerpoint connected to the dishwasher by charging your phone.

If you find out the powerpoint is not working i.e. doesn't supply power, please take a photo when you charge the phone, so we can see there is no power in the photo.

Once verified the cause of the issue, we will then discuss the repair with your landlord accordingly.

Hope this information assists.

Hi Nasser,

Thank you for your email.

If the dishwasher doesn't have any power, please kindly test the powerpoint connected to the dishwasher by charging your phone.

If you find out the powerpoint is not working i.e. doesn't supply power, please take a photo when you charge the phone, so we can see there is no power in the photo.

Once verified the cause of the issue, we will then discuss the repair with your landlord accordingly.

Hope this information assists.

Unfortunately Iâm working full time at the moment, is there any way to reschedule the inspection for any time before 7:45am or after 5:30pm on Monday or any other week day please?

I currently have a fridge and washing machine in the apartment that Iâm not going to need when I move, if the owner of the apartment is interested in buying them off me for $500 so it will be more convenient for the next tenants, please contact me on 0422362004.

Dear Mr Wang

Reference is made to correspondence received from Ms Yuyu Zheng regarding her previous tenancy at 14/1 Defries Avenue, Zetland<https://www.google.com/maps/search/14%2F1+Defries+Avenue,+Zetland?entry=gmail&amp;source=g>.

Ms Zheng has advised NSW Fair Trading that:
- she attended the outgoing inspection at the property and was advised by a representative of your agency that the Landlord was seeking she purchase a new dish washing machine 
- she acknowledges the outer cover of the machine was damaged during her tenancy 
- she notes the machine is 7-8 years old and remains fully functional
- she is willing to compensate the Landlord for the fair value of the damage to the outer cover but believes it is unreasonable that she is required to pay for a brand new machine

It has been confirmed to Ms Zheng that your agency submitted a claim for the refund of the rental bond at the property (P290408-0, refund $1939.00 Managing Agent, refund $141.00 Tenant) which becomes payable on 5/9/2019 if not disputed. Ms Zheng has flagged her intention to ?freeze? this claim. 

Ms Zheng has advised NSW Fair Trading she is seeking:
- the Landlord agree to returning her the balance of the bond for the tenancy, less $300.00 to compensate the Landlord for the fair value of the damage to the outer cover of the dishwasher 

In order to progress this matter further, NSW Fair Trading is seeking:
1) a response from the Landlord in regards to Ms Zheng?s desired outcome?
2) confirmation and a copy of supporting documentation that your agency provided Ms Zheng with the documentation required under Section 165 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2015 within 7 days of the bond claim being made?

Please be advised that in this instance, whilst you are welcome to provide any further supporting documentation, NSW Fair Trading is only seek a response to points 1 and 2 as above. 

NSW Fair Trading is seeking a response to the above by reply email by Friday 6 August 2019. Should you wish to discuss this matter further I may be contacted on 0436 655 187.

Hi Amanda,

Â 

As discussed this morning, at the moment, I only have the landlordâs confirmation email ready as an attachment. 

Â 

My PO will export the conversation email about point 2 from Outlook tomorrow morning and send you together. However, if you would like to review it today, you can find all correspondence in iRental.

Â 

I have also attached a copy of the rent status report of this tenant, except for the dishwasher compensation, she also has $1,440 arrears.

Â 

This tenant moved out on 24/07/2019 and we discussed this matter with her multiple times. We have given her one month before claiming the bond due to no response from her.

Dear Mr Wang

Reference is made to correspondence received from Ms Yuyu Zheng regarding her previous tenancy at 14/1 Defries Avenue, Zetland<https://www.google.com/maps/search/14%2F1+Defries+Avenue,+Zetland?entry=gmail&amp;source=g>.

Ms Zheng has advised NSW Fair Trading that:
- she attended the outgoing inspection at the property and was advised by a representative of your agency that the Landlord was seeking she purchase a new dish washing machine 
- she acknowledges the outer cover of the machine was damaged during her tenancy 
- she notes the machine is 7-8 years old and remains fully functional
- she is willing to compensate the Landlord for the fair value of the damage to the outer cover but believes it is unreasonable that she is required to pay for a brand new machine

It has been confirmed to Ms Zheng that your agency submitted a claim for the refund of the rental bond at the property (P290408-0, refund $1939.00 Managing Agent, refund $141.00 Tenant) which becomes payable on 5/9/2019 if not disputed. Ms Zheng has flagged her intention to ?freeze? this claim. 

Ms Zheng has advised NSW Fair Trading she is seeking:
- the Landlord agree to returning her the balance of the bond for the tenancy, less $300.00 to compensate the Landlord for the fair value of the damage to the outer cover of the dishwasher 

In order to progress this matter further, NSW Fair Trading is seeking:
1) a response from the Landlord in regards to Ms Zheng?s desired outcome?
2) confirmation and a copy of supporting documentation that your agency provided Ms Zheng with the documentation required under Section 165 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2015 within 7 days of the bond claim being made?

Please be advised that in this instance, whilst you are welcome to provide any further supporting documentation, NSW Fair Trading is only seek a response to points 1 and 2 as above. 

NSW Fair Trading is seeking a response to the above by reply email by Friday 6 August 2019. Should you wish to discuss this matter further I may be contacted on 0436 655 187.

Hi
Iris,

Thank
you for answering my call this morning.

As
for the bond claim in the previous tenant's case, we have kept all
communication in oral. I am writing this email to get written confirmation from
you for Fair Trading's investigation on us.

Upon
final inspection with the tenant, she confirmed she had damaged the dishwasher
panel. Under your oral instructions, we have requested the tenants to repair
the damaged panel.

However,
the tenant said she couldn't get it fixed, and we have also consulted with the
appliance repair company that they advised the panel is not economical for
repair.

As a
result, we enquired your instructions on this case and confirmed the tenant is
required to either get the panel fixed or replace the panel.

Since
the tenant is unwilling to take effort to get the panel fixed or replaced, we
asked a replacement quote for the dishwasher at cheapest $499 and asked you
whether you agree to deduct this amount from the tenant's bond as a
repair/replacement equivalent cost to you. The answer we got from you is
positive. Thus we claimed this amount of $499 from the tenant's bond.

Â 

Please
kindly review the above fact statement and let me know whether you agree with
the above facts. Please confirm we have kept you informed of the processes and
acted under your instructions.

If
you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear Mr Wang

Reference is made to correspondence received from Ms Yuyu Zheng regarding her
previous tenancy atÂ 14/1 Defries Avenue, Zetland<https://www.google.com/maps/search/14%2F1+Defries+Avenue,+Zetland?entry=gmail&amp;source=g>.

Ms Zheng has advised NSW Fair Trading that:
- she attended the outgoing inspection at the property and was advised by a
representative of your agency that the Landlord was seeking she purchase a new
dish washing machineÂ 
- she acknowledges the outer cover of the machine was damaged during her
tenancyÂ 
- she notes the machine is 7-8 years old and remains fully functional
- she is willing to compensate the Landlord for the fair value of the damage to
the outer cover but believes it is unreasonable that she is required to pay for
a brand new machine

It has been confirmed to Ms Zheng that your agency submitted a claim for the
refund of the rental bond at the property (P290408-0, refund $1939.00 Managing
Agent, refund $141.00 Tenant) which becomes payable on 5/9/2019 if not
disputed. Ms Zheng has flagged her intention to ?freeze? this claim.Â 

Ms Zheng has advised NSW Fair Trading she is seeking:
- the Landlord agree to returning her the balance of the bond for the tenancy,
less $300.00 to compensate the Landlord for the fair value of the damage to the
outer cover of the dishwasherÂ 

In order to progress this matter further, NSW Fair Trading is seeking:
1) a response from the Landlord in regards to Ms Zheng?s desired outcome?
2) confirmation and a copy of supporting documentation that your agency
provided Ms Zheng with the documentation required under Section 165 of the
Residential Tenancies Act 2015 within 7 days of the bond claim being made?

Please be advised that in this instance, whilst you are welcome to provide any
further supporting documentation, NSW Fair Trading is only seek a response to
points 1 and 2 as above.Â 

NSW Fair Trading is seeking a response to the above by reply email by Friday 6
August 2019. Should you wish to discuss this matter further I may be contacted
on 0436 655 187.

Please unplug all other appliances and use the dryer only for testing, as we will need to confirm if this is a normal electricity overload or a faulty dryer.

Hi Simon,

Thatâs correct. All other items on the circuit (TV, washing machine) function normally for extended periods of time.Â 

Itâs only when dryer runs for 5 mins or more that it trips the circuit breaker and all those appliances then turn off.Â 

Cheers,

Glen

Can you please confirm the trip is triggered by the dryer alone?

You also mentioned the repair last year, do you mean this trip happened since last year repair or just recently?

Hi Simon,

Hope you're well.

We've just noticed that our clothes dryer is tripping the circuit breaker.

We had someone out here to repair it last year as it wasn't heating and while it seemed to work when he tested it for 30s or so, it trips the circuit breaker when run for 5mins or so.Â 

No rush but if you could please organise for someone to come and inspect that'd be great.

Glen

HiÂ Simon,
Thanks for your email for renewingÂ the lease but I am happy to renew contract for next one more year but I am not ok to pay 510$. I want to negotiate it up to 480$ for next one year. If you want to know why then the reason are below:-

1. Because in this building their are lots of cockroaches which keeps coming inside my unit even though i do pest control every 4 month paying 300$ every time. It cost me extra 600 for a year.

2. The floor from the kitchen is start cracking for which i have spend extra money to placed a mat and the dish washing machine is taking the space which i cant even use.

3. Their is another unit in same building i inspect with the same facilities at 480$ weekly.

4. Their is always some problem with the elevator lights in the building.

We have been doing our best to keep this unit clean and will do it better but the price you mentioned is bit high. Please speak with the owner and let me know as soon as possible.Thank you.

Dear Mr. SimonÂ 

I appreciate your clear explanation in the last email.Â 

I have paid my part rent Â to Marshall till Jan 11th. Because usually Â Marshall pays the rent to your account.Â  Due to a relationship breakdown I no longer have access to the apartment since Dec 28th 2020 because my keys were also taken.

For the balance you mentioned in your email, my plan is as the following. I paid Marshall $1040 (50% share of the Rental Bond), and he transferred the total bond amount to Fair Trading from his bank account. I would like to use my bond to pay my portion which I owe you till Jan 11th and also half of the professional cleaning fee which doesnât matter who will arrange it .Â The Police advised me not to communicate with Marshall from Dec 31st 2020. So I am not able to find a joint solution with Marshall.Â I have no any money left now.Â 

Also, I still have some rental furniture (a fridge, a washing machine and a queens bed) in the apartment. They were at a good condition on the day I left. I asked the rental company to contact with Marshall directly to collect them back before Jan 11th. I have not heard any further information yet. Â If Marshall does not cooperate with the rental company, could you please arrange access for them ?

I apologise to you for all the inconvenience we caused.Â  It is just out of my control.Â 

I appreciate your effort and help again.Â 

Kind RegardsÂ 

YukiÂ

The washing machine is left by the previous tenant and the landlord is not going to do anything for the washing machine.

Hi Simon,

ThankingÂ you for coming back to me. Sorry for missing your call earlier also as I was in a meeting at work. I'm surprisedÂ to hear this as the requested photos and videos were sent last Wednesday evening in three separate emails - the same day they were requested. I've re-sent those emails and am attaching the emails and video to this email also. Please confirm receipt.

We can confirm the power point is working - it's being used for theÂ washing machine and for other appliances. As you will see in the video, there is power running to the unit but it makes a sound but doesn't run.

Thanks,

Anthony.

Hi Nasser,

Thank you for your email.

If the dishwasher doesn't have any power, please kindly test the powerpoint connected to the dishwasher by charging your phone.

If you find out the powerpoint is not working i.e. doesn't supply power, please take a photo when you charge the phone, so we can see there is no power in the photo.

Once verified the cause of the issue, we will then discuss the repair with your landlord accordingly.

Hope this information assists.

Hi Simon,

Unfortunately Iâm working full time at the moment, is there any way to reschedule the inspection for any time before 7:45am or after 5:30pm on Monday or any other week day please?

I currently have a fridge and washing machine in the apartment that Iâm not going to need when I move, if the owner of the apartment is interested in buying them off me for $500 so it will be more convenient for the next tenants, please contact me on 0422362004.

Hi Jessica Nicole Palfreyman

Thank you for your email.

I confirm your vacating date will be 28/09/2019 as per notice required. (3 weeks' rule: http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/rta2010207/s97.html)

Please find the attachment for the outstanding rent payment and outstanding invoices until your vacating and the final inspection guide.

For your information, total balance of rent and current invoices until your vacating date is $-1,228.99 (refer to attached status report).

In according to the cleaning, please organise professional cleaning to avoid any outstanding issue remaining the property which may affect your bond release.

Freddy: 0424 382 070

Pest control 
Elite Pest Control: 0450507378 
Safeguard Pest Contol: 0427388994

Iâve scheduled your outgoing inspection to be conducted 10:30AM Monday 16/09/2019. We prefer both parties are on site to finalise the condition and bond.

We suggest to tenant extend the utilities service such as electricity and gas for 2 days in order to have all relevant item can be checkout on the outgoing inspection, or for the tradesman to rectify the item if any outstanding condition required to be rectified. Please note, your bond release can be delayed if the items are not rectified upon outgoing inspection.

In the meantime, we will carry out the open inspection to obtain the new tenant, we will inform you for the open inspection time beforehand. Generally, open inspections will take up only 15 minutes of your time on a weekday afternoon and Saturday morning. My colleagues and Iâll ensure all attendees are carefully monitored and cause minimal disturbance to you and your property.

Your landlord would like to thank you in advance for the cooperation.

Just finally, please provide a brief reason why your vacating, if youâre considering alternate rental accommodation throughout the greater Sydney, please refer https://www.pia.com.au/en/rent-property/ for a list of our currently available properties.

Dear Mr Wang

Reference is made to correspondence received from Ms Yuyu Zheng regarding her previous tenancy at 14/1 Defries Avenue, Zetland<https://www.google.com/maps/search/14%2F1+Defries+Avenue,+Zetland?entry=gmail&amp;source=g>.

Ms Zheng has advised NSW Fair Trading that:
- she attended the outgoing inspection at the property and was advised by a representative of your agency that the Landlord was seeking she purchase a new dish washing machine 
- she acknowledges the outer cover of the machine was damaged during her tenancy 
- she notes the machine is 7-8 years old and remains fully functional
- she is willing to compensate the Landlord for the fair value of the damage to the outer cover but believes it is unreasonable that she is required to pay for a brand new machine

It has been confirmed to Ms Zheng that your agency submitted a claim for the refund of the rental bond at the property (P290408-0, refund $1939.00 Managing Agent, refund $141.00 Tenant) which becomes payable on 5/9/2019 if not disputed. Ms Zheng has flagged her intention to ?freeze? this claim. 

Ms Zheng has advised NSW Fair Trading she is seeking:
- the Landlord agree to returning her the balance of the bond for the tenancy, less $300.00 to compensate the Landlord for the fair value of the damage to the outer cover of the dishwasher 

In order to progress this matter further, NSW Fair Trading is seeking:
1) a response from the Landlord in regards to Ms Zheng?s desired outcome?
2) confirmation and a copy of supporting documentation that your agency provided Ms Zheng with the documentation required under Section 165 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2015 within 7 days of the bond claim being made?

Please be advised that in this instance, whilst you are welcome to provide any further supporting documentation, NSW Fair Trading is only seek a response to points 1 and 2 as above. 

NSW Fair Trading is seeking a response to the above by reply email by Friday 6 August 2019. Should you wish to discuss this matter further I may be contacted on 0436 655 187.

Please find attached correspondence related to this case.

I have attached tenant ledger for this property. As the vacating confirmation email was not exported from Outlook due to technical issue, we exported it from gmail.

In summary, the tenant was informed the outstanding rent before the bond claim as well as the quote for dishwasher replacement. The tenant also attended the final inspection and are aware of the dishwasher damage caused by her.

Hope this information assists.

Kind regards,

Dear Mr Wang

Reference is made to correspondence received from Ms Yuyu Zheng regarding her previous tenancy at 14/1 Defries Avenue, Zetland<https://www.google.com/maps/search/14%2F1+Defries+Avenue,+Zetland?entry=gmail&amp;source=g>.

Ms Zheng has advised NSW Fair Trading that:
- she attended the outgoing inspection at the property and was advised by a representative of your agency that the Landlord was seeking she purchase a new dish washing machine 
- she acknowledges the outer cover of the machine was damaged during her tenancy 
- she notes the machine is 7-8 years old and remains fully functional
- she is willing to compensate the Landlord for the fair value of the damage to the outer cover but believes it is unreasonable that she is required to pay for a brand new machine

It has been confirmed to Ms Zheng that your agency submitted a claim for the refund of the rental bond at the property (P290408-0, refund $1939.00 Managing Agent, refund $141.00 Tenant) which becomes payable on 5/9/2019 if not disputed. Ms Zheng has flagged her intention to ?freeze? this claim. 

Ms Zheng has advised NSW Fair Trading she is seeking:
- the Landlord agree to returning her the balance of the bond for the tenancy, less $300.00 to compensate the Landlord for the fair value of the damage to the outer cover of the dishwasher 

In order to progress this matter further, NSW Fair Trading is seeking:
1) a response from the Landlord in regards to Ms Zheng?s desired outcome?
2) confirmation and a copy of supporting documentation that your agency provided Ms Zheng with the documentation required under Section 165 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2015 within 7 days of the bond claim being made?

Please be advised that in this instance, whilst you are welcome to provide any further supporting documentation, NSW Fair Trading is only seek a response to points 1 and 2 as above. 

NSW Fair Trading is seeking a response to the above by reply email by Friday 6 August 2019. Should you wish to discuss this matter further I may be contacted on 0436 655 187.

As discussed this morning, at the moment, I only have the landlordâs confirmation email ready as an attachment. 

My PO will export the conversation email about point 2 from Outlook tomorrow morning and send you together. However, if you would like to review it today, you can find all correspondence in iRental.

I have also attached a copy of the rent status report of this tenant, except for the dishwasher compensation, she also has $1,440 arrears.

This tenant moved out on 24/07/2019 and we discussed this matter with her multiple times. We have given her one month before claiming the bond due to no response from her.

Hi
Iris,

Thank
you for answering my call this morning.

As
for the bond claim in the previous tenant's case, we have kept all
communication in oral. I am writing this email to get written confirmation from
you for Fair Trading's investigation on us.

Upon
final inspection with the tenant, she confirmed she had damaged the dishwasher
panel. Under your oral instructions, we have requested the tenants to repair
the damaged panel.

However,
the tenant said she couldn't get it fixed, and we have also consulted with the
appliance repair company that they advised the panel is not economical for
repair.

As a
result, we enquired your instructions on this case and confirmed the tenant is
required to either get the panel fixed or replace the panel.

Since
the tenant is unwilling to take effort to get the panel fixed or replaced, we
asked a replacement quote for the dishwasher at cheapest $499 and asked you
whether you agree to deduct this amount from the tenant's bond as a
repair/replacement equivalent cost to you. The answer we got from you is
positive. Thus we claimed this amount of $499 from the tenant's bond.

Â 

Please
kindly review the above fact statement and let me know whether you agree with
the above facts. Please confirm we have kept you informed of the processes and
acted under your instructions.

If
you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear Mr Wang

Reference is made to correspondence received from Ms Yuyu Zheng regarding her
previous tenancy atÂ 14/1 Defries Avenue, Zetland<https://www.google.com/maps/search/14%2F1+Defries+Avenue,+Zetland?entry=gmail&amp;source=g>.

Ms Zheng has advised NSW Fair Trading that:
- she attended the outgoing inspection at the property and was advised by a
representative of your agency that the Landlord was seeking she purchase a new
dish washing machineÂ 
- she acknowledges the outer cover of the machine was damaged during her
tenancyÂ 
- she notes the machine is 7-8 years old and remains fully functional
- she is willing to compensate the Landlord for the fair value of the damage to
the outer cover but believes it is unreasonable that she is required to pay for
a brand new machine

It has been confirmed to Ms Zheng that your agency submitted a claim for the
refund of the rental bond at the property (P290408-0, refund $1939.00 Managing
Agent, refund $141.00 Tenant) which becomes payable on 5/9/2019 if not
disputed. Ms Zheng has flagged her intention to ?freeze? this claim.Â 

Ms Zheng has advised NSW Fair Trading she is seeking:
- the Landlord agree to returning her the balance of the bond for the tenancy,
less $300.00 to compensate the Landlord for the fair value of the damage to the
outer cover of the dishwasherÂ 

In order to progress this matter further, NSW Fair Trading is seeking:
1) a response from the Landlord in regards to Ms Zheng?s desired outcome?
2) confirmation and a copy of supporting documentation that your agency
provided Ms Zheng with the documentation required under Section 165 of the
Residential Tenancies Act 2015 within 7 days of the bond claim being made?

Please be advised that in this instance, whilst you are welcome to provide any
further supporting documentation, NSW Fair Trading is only seek a response to
points 1 and 2 as above.Â 

NSW Fair Trading is seeking a response to the above by reply email by Friday 6
August 2019. Should you wish to discuss this matter further I may be contacted
on 0436 655 187.

Thank you for your email.

NBN will need to be set up under your own internet account. For initial NBN connection fee, the landlord can reimburse the tenants this cost once you forwarded relevant invoices and your bank account details.

For space measurements, you can check the floor plan in the online advertisement as a general reference.

Hope this information assists.

Good Morning Owners and Residents, 

Â 

Can the person who dumped the Maytag Washing Machines in the bin room please get in contact with me. Or if anyone knows who this was, please let me know so that we can follow this up with the correct person. 

Â 

As per previous correspondence relating to dumped items, all Residents are able to arrange 2 free council collections for their ânon-householdâ rubbish via the Council website. By placing this type of item in the bin room, it creates a situation where the rubbish bins may not be able to be collected, and applies additional costs for the Owners Corporation for the removal.

As per previous correspondence relating to dumped items, all Residents are able to arrange 2 free council collections for their ânon-householdâ rubbish via the Council website. By placing this type of item in the bin room, it creates a situation where the rubbish bins may not be able to be collected, and applies additional costs for the Owners Corporation for the removal.

Dear Owners, Agents and Residents,

Â 

I hope this email finds you well.

Â

Â 

L1,l-1 & B1 will be completed on Monday 19 October 2020 from 8:30 AM â 4:30 PM

Â 

B2 will be completed on Tuesday 20 October 2020 from 8:30 AM â 4:30 PM

Please note that if there are any cars that are present on the levels on the given attendance date that has been arranged, the floor space beneath the car will not be attended to. With the high pressure washing machines being used, we are unable to come close to any cars to avoid damaging the paint and wheels, so only the areas around the cars will be services, not the floor space beneath. For this reason is it extremely important that all cars are removed from the area to ensure all floor space is able to be attended to.

Â 

Agents, please ensure you urgently notify your tenants for their information and call if needed.

Thanking you for your co-operation!

It is not working by 90%; in other words, it is usually suspended and does not work well.Â

This is in concern to water issues.

So I came back home after work at 5 pm and put my clothes in washing machine to wash. My washing machine started to make noice.

Only then I realized that there is no water coming in any of the taps.

I am concerned as nothing was informed about it and I tried calling you and there was no answer.

Is there any way to understand what's going on ?

As I am yet to prepare my dinner and no water to drink also.

This is a seriousÂ issue and would like to hear back from you asap.

Many thanks

Hi Phillip,

The dryer has been delivered and the driver installed it onto the existing brackets as well as removed the old one so the cost will only be the dryer and delivery charge that I have paid. 

As agreed, please organise cash reimbursement to my bank account amount of $296.99 as per EFT details below:

Bank name: 86400 Bank

Account name: Jacquiline KC

BSB: 670-864

Account number: 1034 3958

Reimbursement amount: $296.99 AUD

I have attached is the payment receipt, delivery note and tax invoice. 

Also attached is the compliance sticker containing the model and serial number and instructions for the owner to register the product in their name.

Thank you for your email.

Apologies, SMS can be overlooked â particularly given the quantity of SMS and unable to flag as reminder or for action.

If unable to install the dryer, your landlord has agreed to send a handy-man to install if necessary. We await your feedback. 

Rather than deduct the cost from rent, please provide the invoice and your account details; the cost to be reimbursed to your account.

As per SMS sent to you on Saturday 14/12 we have taken the dryer off the brackets ready for removal. 

I can try to ask the delivery driver to rehook a new Simpson dryer onto the existing brackets or try ourselves. Otherwise the owner will need a someone to install.

Hope thisÂ email finds you well. 

Sorry to trouble you as this is my 3rd email to you regarding the dryer.

I hope you can appreciate the yard does get rather dusty with no clothes lines therefore we've been doing the weekly bedsheets at my mum's house and hanging some clothes inside. 

I understand that you'll need to get the owner's approval for the repair but I do hope that you'll contact the owner and let me know when will you let me know when it'll be fixed?

Thank you.

Alarm

Thank you again for your assistance with alarm no longer being armed with the code you provided. I've also turned off the switch and unplugged the power plug. But there's still light on and last night it beeped. No siren but beeped. I again press the code 8082 like you said and it stopped beeping but now the fire light is on (See image). Will this be an issue or am I okay to ignore it?

Dryer

The dryer won't start or turn on. The power socket (1 out of 2 is working) as I've been able to plug in the washing machine and already done 2 loads. I've hung the clothes on my own clothes rack but it's raining now and our clothes are still wet. Will you please organise a service call? 

I can raise one on your behalf if you consent in writing to have the Bill To (invoice payable) to PIA. I know the dryer is out of warranty and I've done the troubleshooting. 

I work for Electrolux and the dryer model Simpson is one of our brands. Thus I can book a service with staff discount if you're happy for me to pay first and then deduct from the rent due on 10/12?

Thank you Phillip. Let me know your thoughts and decision.

Subject: Re: Unit 28/20-24 Sorrell Street, PARRAMATTA - Electricity reimbursement

Dear Tony,

Greetings, Thanks for the update, see it is not the benefit from the landload and is an agreement.

I will explain better. The family energy benefit is for us and not for others to share. We received the benefit and not others. The agreement is to share 70% and 30% ratio. 

Ideally it should be 50% 50% sharing, the reason is - when we signed the agreement your associate said only one person living in 28A, but there are multiple people living and using the dryer, washing machine, and everythingÂ happens in electricity, we use gas for cooking, they are using electricity for everything including cooking. Keeping that aside.

If me and you travel in the train and if I receive a student benefit and if you don't you shouldn't be askingÂ to share my student benefit. If you really want to make clear then please add clearly in the agreement and advise customer in the first place. 

Please proceed for the reimbursement however you decide, and let us know once payment isÂ made

Let me know if anymore details needed on this

Thanks

Gajalakshmi Jayakumar

Hi Jayakumar & Gajalakshmi,

Thank you for your email.

I am afraid is an unreasonable request to tell your landlord to pay the full amount.

The bill shows your payment is $773.88.

The landlord will reimburse 70% of your payment.

As you previous email that the NSW government already gave you the benefit.

You can not earn twice of the benefit from your landlord and the government.

Please confirm then we will proceed the reimbursement.

Hope the information assists and have a nice day!

Thanks Tony, We are receiving family tax benefit and that is execlusively for the family not to share with others, would you like to share with others, it is not the discount from the electricity provider and is from the NSW government for the family. We are not asking the discounts what energy provider provides, hope it makes sense.

Otherwise please let me know, it is completely unacceptable.

Please let me know if any more details needed on this.

I just wanted to email you to let you know that on the day of signing the lease, Tom Fu directed me to email you for the overchargedÂ amount of $2450 that I already paid by BPay, but then repaid again on the 02/10. Would I be able to get those funds transferred back to me?

I also wanted to confirm that during our inspection of the property, we mentioned we would like to install our own washing machine instead of having the one currently installed. Would this be possible to remove this?

I have a few more questions,

It wasn't quite clear during the meeting, but I was wondering if utilities are all separate from the rent? Electricity, gas and water?

We tried to locate the parking space in the parking lot as well as our storage cage, but we couldn't find it. Could you advise which level it is?

We also mentioned that there will be 4 people living in the unit, we kindly ask to order two more swipe card keys.

I will be sending you through our condition report in a separate email, along with photos and videos of the property.

Kind regards,

Thanks for updating.

I think I should mention this issue again.

I stated the issue in the condition report when I moved in, but it was not taken care of any of you no matter the agent or the owner. And we never used this dish washing machine. Therefore, I should not and will not pay any charge of this issue. 

And this is not negotiable at all.

Thanks for your understanding.

Cheers,

Chao

Hi Chao Mu; Yina Zhao,

Hope allâs well.

For your update, a work order has just been sent to the assigned tradesman will contact you shortly to attend the issue.

For your information, can be reached on , 1300567637 and email address is workorders@stovedoc.com.au<mailto:workorders@stovedoc.com.au>.

If you do not hear from anyone whoâs been instructed in a timely manner, please notify me to follow up.

Once again, once the tradesman attends only to find misuse/damage caused by the user rather than a fault with the item/matter, I am afraid that the tenant will be liable for any associated charges.

In the meantime, thank you for your patience.

How are you?

In terms of the dish washing machine issue, it was not the first time we reported it .

Actually we reported this issue right after we moved into the property.

It is in theÂ Condition Report. You can check it in the attachment.

And also I attached two photos for your reference.

Please fix this as soon as possible, otherwise the property might get damaged.

Hi Vicki,

Currently we are facing the problem about dish washing machine in our property.

It is a new one since we moved in and we never use that. I think we raised the issue that the water in the machine cannot go away, but got no response from you. Now the problem becomes serious. There is a lot of water in the machine for a while. Please ask someone to fix the problem and connect the dish washing machine to the drain in kitchen

Cheersï¼

Dear Vicki,

Â 

Just wondering how the fix request is going for the burner and power point. I have also just been advised by my wife that the dryer has now ceased to work.

It stopped while she was using it. She has switched it off at the power point, checked fuse breakers and switched back on. Seems to have power but not activating.

Â 

regards

It appears that it is the powerpoint. I attach a video. Yes it is of my washing machine and not the dryer but it is to show that the washing machine is on but the powerpoint is off. So no power should be going to the machine. Both switches move freely with no detente or click. The light switch as i can see works correctly.

Regards

Brian

I have not confirmed about key collection with tenant.

We did have talked about cleaning and their washing machine.

I will need your instruction for key collection as i don't have any record which key was given to tenant before.

Any key collection I confirm with email or via text message.

Thank youÂ for your email. 

I hope the tradesman could find the issue, and fixÂ the problem for our convenience. In case he finds any problem which makes you believe it's because of the tenant, I firmly trust that it has nothing to do with us since we have reported to Mohammad on 27th of May. 

We've just got our washing machine 2 week after we had moved in. Hence, the problem was not mentioned in the condition report. 

We all know it well that the unit is aged with numerous of downgrades and issues. Therefore, we deeply appreciate your patience and support for us from the beginning till now. Hopefully, these issues could be fixed thoroughly so that we don't have to bother your timeÂ again. 

Again, thank you so much for your help. Wishing youÂ all the best through this tough time.

Trust you are doing well. Any further updates on the washing machine power point issue please. As I said, with a one year old in the house we are running a risk by extending a connector from the TV port in addition to the inconvenience this is causing for past three weeks. Kindly request for a speedy resolution

Okay no worries, but regarding âwhite goodsâ we did not dispose of any at all. The only white rubbish we disposed of was foam.

So upon our next delivery of furniture, if it has foam packaging again, do we dispose in the garbage room on ground floor or do we call first? Apologies if this is confusing, Iâm just trying to understand, if the foam we have put into rubbish is in fact defined as white goods or bulk rubbish (again my understanding of bulk rubbish applies to a council pickup for furniture/household goods and white goods).

Dear Vicki,

Â 

Hope this email finds you well and thank you for your
information.

Â 

Also, thank the landlord for offering renewed agreement.

Â 

However, we would not accept the renewed agreement at $540
per week.Â 

Â 

This building is too old and its quality is not good
enough. We came across air conditioning broken issue and washing machine leaking
issues, which caused us much inconvenience.

Â 

We have searched on the website and found that the rent
price in mascot is declining. But if the rent price could be reduced to $520,
we still like to sign the contract for one more year.

Â 

Could you check with the landlord whether he/she could
reduce the rent price and confirm with us at your earliest convenience?

Â 

Hope to hear from you soon.

Â 

Best wishes

Frank

Hi Vicki,

Steven, who did our house inspection yesterday, mentioned that you were our new property manager. so we have the requests as following:

On Tuesday night I was doing the washing and mid cycle the washing machine stopped. 

Prior to that there were no issues however it seems that the powerpoint on the right has been very temperamental since then it either wonât turn on at all or will for a minute than off again. 

Our washer and dryer is not the problem.

We would like to have a technician sent out to have this assessed as it is a hazard and we need the washer and dryer.

We would also like to request someone to come out and assess the intercom. 

It has had issues with allowing people upstairs, we have always had to go down and collect any visitors since we have moved however now when we are answering they do not hear us on the other end.

I shall wait for your email and I shall follow up if I donât hear anything within 24 hours.

Thanks in advance,

Indiana Dyakina

I trust the unit passed inspection following Marvin's clean.Â  He guarantees it will so I will need to know if it hasn't.

Were there any washing machine attachments left?Â  If so, I will need to pick them up.Â Â 

I see we have been set a date for the hearing. I've not heard anything new regarding compensation so it looks like we will be going ahead.Â 

Regarding forwarding address, has the unit got a tenant in yet?Â  If so, I will write them a letter and give them an address to forward my mail to until I've had the chance to inform all of my contacts.

Finally, when will I get the bond back?

ï»¿Hi
Miki,Â 

Â 

First
of all, I never received any communication today from any party regarding the
inspection of the premises. In fact you contacted Lorna who is not even in the
state. So if you wanted action to be taken promptly then you should have
informed both of us tenants. Since you didnât inform me you have left too short
notice that I canât possibly make it at those times as I am a working
professional. This is both unfair and unreasonable.Â 

Â 

Also
I would like to add that we left the apartment in a very clean state. As per
the NSW guidelines for rental tenancy, it states that the residence must be
âreasonably cleanâ. Can you please indicate what part of leaving cleaning
products in the cupboard or a sock in the washing machine leaves it
unreasonably clean?Â 

<image0.png>

Â 

We
have been nothing but good tenants, caused no problems and have been very
respectful of the property. I am very disappointed Â that you are trying to
take money off us for something that is not our responsibility and you are not
giving us a suitable chance to rectify the problem. I have no problem disputing
this with you.

Â 

Also
I would like to add that we have left the apartment in the very state it was
given to us. It was certainly not professionally cleaned and so we have cleaned
it to a standard that it was when we begun our lease. We have cleaned
adequately and do not appreciate that you are trying to charge us $450 dollars
for a sock in the washing machine and some cleaning products in the cupboard
when we were not given the same courtesy when we moved in. In fact there were
reminants of the previous tenant even when we moved in.Â 

Â 

I
would like to discuss this further with you please contact me on
0491947830.Â

Deirdre

Hi Lorna & Deirdre,

Hope you are well!

I have conducted the inspection on 10/05/2021 and the whole property need to
redo the cleaning and there are some left goods inside the property. (photo
attached)

we need to rectifyÂ  the cleaning issues as soon as possible due to the
new tenant will move in soon. As we discussed through the phone around 17:00
today,Â  we offered you that if you would like to go back to the property
to rectify

by you end,Â  please collect the keys from our Olympic Park office by
tomorrow 11/05/2021 10:00am and return the key at 18:00 same day.Â  but I
didn't get any feedback from you till 7:00pm today.

I checked with the cleaner to rectify the outstanding cleaning issues will
be $450+GST,

soÂ  please kindly advise me by tomorrow before 10:00am whether or not
you would like to rectify the issues by you end.Â 

Regarding the other issues we will send through other report as soon as
possible.

ï»¿Hi Miki,Â 

First of all, I never received any communication today from any party regarding the inspection of the premises. In fact you contacted Lorna who is not even in the state. So if you wanted action to be taken promptly then you should have informed both of us tenants. Since you didnât inform me you have left too short notice that I canât possibly make it at those times as I am a working professional. This is both unfair and unreasonable.Â 

Also I would like to add that we left the apartment in a very clean state. As per the NSW guidelines for rental tenancy, it states that the residence must be âreasonably cleanâ. Can you please indicate what part of leaving cleaning products in the cupboard or a sock in the washing machine leaves it unreasonably clean?Â 
<image0.png>

We have been nothing but good tenants, caused no problems and have been very respectful of the property. I am very disappointed Â that you are trying to take money off us for something that is not our responsibility and you are not giving us a suitable chance to rectify the problem. I have no problem disputing this with you.

Also I would like to add that we have left the apartment in the very state it was given to us. It was certainly not professionally cleaned and so we have cleaned it to a standard that it was when we begun our lease. We have cleaned adequately and do not appreciate that you are trying to charge us $450 dollars for a sock in the washing machine and some cleaning products in the cupboard when we were not given the same courtesy when we moved in. In fact there were reminants of the previous tenant even when we moved in.Â 

I would like to discuss this further with you please contact me on 0491947830.Â

Dear Vicki,

Â 

Hope this email finds you well and thank you for your information.

Â 

Also, thank the landlord for offering renewed agreement.

Â 

However, we would not accept the renewed agreement at $540 per week.Â 

Â 

This building is too old and its quality is not good enough. We came across air conditioning broken issue and washing machine leaking issues, which caused us much inconvenience.

Â 

We have searched on the website and found that the rent price in mascot is declining. But if the rent price could be reduced to $520, we still like to sign the contract for one more year.

Â 

Could you check with the landlord whether he/she could reduce the rent price and confirm with us at your earliest convenience?

Â 

Hope to hear from you soon.

Â 

Best wishes

Frank

Dear Zixi Zhu & Xiaolu Chen ,

We hope all's well.

Great News!!

We have pleasure in advising you that the landlord is agreed the rent is to remain at $540.00 Weekly and not to be increased at this stage.

Also, we note from our records that your fixed term tenancy agreement end(ed) 12/09/2019. Your landlord has instructed us to offer you a renewed fixed term agreement for a period of 12 Months at the current rent.

Provided that your lease is renewed for a fixed term, your rent cannot be increased during this period.

Furthermore, we have also been instructed to again seek instructions from your landlord regarding rent in the upcoming months. Should you remain without a fixed term agreement.

To initiate the process in order to renew a fixed term lease, contact your property manager Vicki Zhao on vickizhao@pia.com.au<mailto:vickizhao@pia.com.au> as soon as possible.

Prior to that there were no issues however it seems that the powerpoint on the right has been very temperamental since then it either wonât turn on at all or will for a minute than off again. 

Â 

Our washer and dryer is not the problem.

Â 

We would like to have a technician sent out to have this assessed as it is a hazard and we need the washer and dryer.

Â 

We would also like to request someone to come out and assess the intercom. 

Â 

It has had issues with allowing people upstairs, we have always had to go down and collect any visitors since we have moved however now when we are answering they do not hear us on the other end.

Â 

I shall wait for your email and I shall follow up if I donât hear anything within 24 hours.

Â 

Thanks in advance,

Hi Vicki,

How are you?

In terms of the dish washing machine issue, it was not the first time we reported it .

Actually we reported this issue right after we moved into the property.

It is in theÂ Condition Report. You can check it in the attachment.

And also I attached two photos for your reference.

Please fix this as soon as possible, otherwise the property might get damaged.

Hi Vicki,

Currently we are facing the problem about dish washing machine in our property.

It is a new one since we moved in and we never use that. I think we raised the issue that the water in the machine cannot go away, but got no response from you. Now the problem becomes serious. There is a lot of water in the machine for a while. Please ask someone to fix the problem and connect the dish washing machine to the drain in kitchen

Hi Miki, 

First of all, I never received any communication today from any party regarding the inspection of the premises. In fact you contacted Lorna who is not even in the state. So if you wanted action to be taken promptly then you should have informed both of us tenants. Since you didnât inform me you have left too short notice that I canât possibly make it at those times as I am a working professional. This is both unfair and unreasonable. 

Also I would like to add that we left the apartment in a very clean state. As per the NSW guidelines for rental tenancy, it states that the residence must be âreasonably cleanâ. Can you please indicate what part of leaving cleaning products in the cupboard or a sock in the washing machine leaves it unreasonably clean? <cid:1B8DD322-9B38-480A-BE5A-F23623E9BDD1-L0-001>

We have been nothing but good tenants, caused no problems and have been very respectful of the property. I am very disappointed that you are trying to take money off us for something that is not our responsibility and you are not giving us a suitable chance to rectify the problem. I have no problem disputing this with you.

Also I would like to add that we have left the apartment in the very state it was given to us. It was certainly not professionally cleaned and so we have cleaned it to a standard that it was when we begun our lease. We have cleaned adequately and do not appreciate that you are trying to charge us $450 dollars for a sock in the washing machine and some cleaning products in the cupboard when we were not given the same courtesy when we moved in. In fact there were reminants of the previous tenant even when we moved in. 

I would like to discuss this further with you please contact me on 0491947830. 

Regards,

Deirdre White

Just wondering how the fix request is going for the burner and power point. I have also just been advised by my wife that the dryer has now ceased to work.

It stopped while she was using it. She has switched it off at the power point, checked fuse breakers and switched back on. Seems to have power but not activating.

Dear Vicki,

I have not confirmed about key collection with tenant.

We did have talked about cleaning and their washing machine.

I will need your instruction for key collection as i don't have any record which key was given to tenant before.

Any key collection I confirm with email or via text message.

If you do not hear from anyone whoâs been instructed in a timely manner, please notify me to follow up.

Once again, once the tradesman attends only to find misuse/damage caused by the user rather than a fault with the item/matter, I am afraid that the tenant will be liable for any associated charges.

Hi Vicki,

I'd just like to point out that my name went off your rental ledger atÂ 27/09/2018 (When I actually left the property and processed the change in tenancy papers with Eddie & Jessica) then strangely came backÂ in 10/10/2019 (Obviously incorrect, as I left over a year ago)

Can you please explain what happened then?

Thanks

Nick

Hi Vicki,

Steven, who did our house inspection yesterday, mentioned that you were our new property manager. so we have the requests as following:

On Tuesday night I was doing the washing and mid cycle the washing machine stopped. 

Prior to that there were no issues however it seems that the powerpoint on the right has been very temperamental since then it either wonât turn on at all or will for a minute than off again. 

Our washer and dryer is not the problem.

We would like to have a technician sent out to have this assessed as it is a hazard and we need the washer and dryer.

We would also like to request someone to come out and assess the intercom. 

It has had issues with allowing people upstairs, we have always had to go down and collect any visitors since we have moved however now when we are answering they do not hear us on the other end.

I shall wait for your email and I shall follow up if I donât hear anything within 24 hours.

Thanks in advance,

Indiana Dyakina

Hi Chuhan,

Â 

Thanks for your email. 

Have you tried to clean up the bottom or the out water pipe in the dishwasher? We have many similar case of the dishwashers which is mainly resulted by food blockage. 

We can get a technician to come and fix the problem. However, if they find out the cause is due to food blockage, the tenant will be responsible for the repair cost. 

Would you like to try from your side to avoid potential cost from your side? 

Â 

Kind regards,

Mew, Yanheng Tang

ï»¿Hello Mew, 

Â 

Thank you for your information.

Â I would like to ask whether you received the email in relation to our request on the manual of the dishwashing machine early this month?

Â 

Can you kindly provide us with the full electric manual then we can make sure we manipulate it correctly, before you send out your tradesman?Â 

Â 

Without the manual we cannot tell whether the issue is with us or in the machine itself.Â 

Â 

Thank you

Â 

Regards

GraceÂ

Hi Chuhan Wu; Qian Sun,

Hope allâs well.

For your update, we have submitted your maintenance request to the landlord with quotations for seeking their consideration and approval.

For your information, once the tradesman attends only to find misuse/damage rather than a fault with the unit/s, youâll be liable for any associated charges.

Thank you for your continuous patience.

I hope this email finds you well.

Â 

Please find attached letter in relation to a Basement Pressure Clean that will commence on the following:

Â 

L1,l-1 & B1 will be completed on Monday 19 October 2020 from 8:30 AM â 4:30 PM

Â 

Please note that if there are any cars that are present on the levels on the given attendance date that has been arranged, the floor space beneath the car will not be attended to. With the high pressure washing machines being used, we are unable to come close to any cars to avoid damaging the paint and wheels, so only the areas around the cars will be services, not the floor space beneath. For this reason is it extremely important that all cars are removed from the area to ensure all floor space is able to be attended to.

Â 

Agents, please ensure you urgently notify your tenants for their information and call if needed.

Â 

Thanking you for your co-operation!

This is in concern to water issues.

So I came back home after work at 5 pm and put my clothes in washing machine to wash. My washing machine started to make noice.

Only then I realized that there is no water coming in any of the taps.

I am concerned as nothing was informed about it and I tried calling you and there was no answer.

Is there any way to understand what's going on ?

As I am yet to prepare my dinner and no water to drink also.

This is a seriousÂ issue and would like to hear back from you asap.

Many thanks

Eva

Subject: Re: Unit 28/20-24 Sorrell Street, PARRAMATTA - Electricity reimbursement

Dear Tony,

Greetings, Thanks for the update, see it is not the benefit from the landload and is an agreement.

I will explain better. The family energy benefit is for us and not for others to share. We received the benefit and not others. The agreement is to share 70% and 30% ratio. 

Ideally it should be 50% 50% sharing, the reason is - when we signed the agreement your associate said only one person living in 28A, but there are multiple people living and using the dryer, washing machine, and everythingÂ happens in electricity, we use gas for cooking, they are using electricity for everything including cooking. Keeping that aside.

If me and you travel in the train and if I receive a student benefit and if you don't you shouldn't be askingÂ to share my student benefit. If you really want to make clear then please add clearly in the agreement and advise customer in the first place. 

Please proceed for the reimbursement however you decide, and let us know once payment isÂ made

Let me know if anymore details needed on this

Thanks

Hi Jayakumar & Gajalakshmi,

I am afraid is an unreasonable request to tell your landlord to pay the full amount.

The bill shows your payment is $773.88.

The landlord will reimburse 70% of your payment.

As you previous email that the NSW government already gave you the benefit.

You can not earn twice of the benefit from your landlord and the government.

Please confirm then we will proceed the reimbursement.

Thanks Tony, We are receiving family tax benefit and that is execlusively for the family not to share with others, would you like to share with others, it is not the discount from the electricity provider and is from the NSW government for the family. We are not asking the discounts what energy provider provides, hope it makes sense.

Otherwise please let me know, it is completely unacceptable.

He puts the cloths washing machine and is not removing for days, everytime we have to tell him to take the cloths but we think taht he purposefully keeps the cloths in the washing machine / dryer for days. I assume he would have known that we have reported to you and hence now makes more of inconveneince to us. Please note this is a shared systems and we need to respect others Privacy, convenience. 

What we request is:
1) We can't tolerate fucking screaming
2) We can't wait for days to put our cloths for washing as he purposefully keeps the cloths and washing machine and dryer.

Please note - it is not like we wanted to make trouble or complain fellow tenants unnecessarily, we are professionals and expect bare minimum things to live comfortably.

Dear Team,

Greetings toyou, We needed to bring to your notice that the disturbances we get from theUNIT 28A,Â  please note the person who stays in the unit brings differentdifferent girls and fucks everyday with louder noice and screaming, We knowthat's their personal but you can't fuck in a way that is disturbing othersthat too where young family and kids are staying,Â  the other day my kidswere asking what was those sound, do you know how i felt bad.

Â 

We are stayingwith family and it's troubling a lot.Â  We feel he takes drug and somethingof that kind and it makes us scared and afraid. In the night frequently we getlouder noises with multiple people in the Unit, not sure what they do that timewith so much noise and we get some smells , definitely those are durgs but notsure what are those. 

Â 

We expectcomfortable living as we live with two little daughers. Let me know if any moredetails needed , you can very well scan/go through your CCTV details tounderstand the girls he brings.

Â 

Note: Initiallywe thought it is one of that kind, but it keep on growing and goes beyondunacceptable level, we felt shy/reluctant to talk on this topic, but it isbetter to be late than never, prevention is better than cure.Â

Kindly note, wedo not want any trouble with neighbours and we would request to keep theconfidentiality of the information.

Dear Mr Wang

Reference is made to correspondence received from Ms Yuyu Zheng regarding
her previous tenancy at 14/1 Defries Avenue, Zetland.

Ms Zheng has advised NSW Fair Trading that:
- she attended the outgoing inspection at the property and was advised by
a representative of your agency that the Landlord was seeking she purchase
a new dish washing machine
- she acknowledges the outer cover of the machine was damaged during her
tenancy
- she notes the machine is 7-8 years old and remains fully functional
- she is willing to compensate the Landlord for the fair value of the
damage to the outer cover but believes it is unreasonable that she is
required to pay for a brand new machine

It has been confirmed to Ms Zheng that your agency submitted a claim for
the refund of the rental bond at the property (P290408-0, refund $1939.00
Managing Agent, refund $141.00 Tenant) which becomes payable on 5/9/2019
if not disputed. Ms Zheng has flagged her intention to ?freeze? this
claim.

Ms Zheng has advised NSW Fair Trading she is seeking:
- the Landlord agree to returning her the balance of the bond for the
tenancy, less $300.00 to compensate the Landlord for the fair value of the
damage to the outer cover of the dishwasher

In order to progress this matter further, NSW Fair Trading is seeking:
1) a response from the Landlord in regards to Ms Zheng?s desired outcome?
2) confirmation and a copy of supporting documentation that your agency
provided Ms Zheng with the documentation required under Section 165 of the
Residential Tenancies Act 2015 within 7 days of the bond claim being made?

Please be advised that in this instance, whilst you are welcome to provide
any further supporting documentation, NSW Fair Trading is only seek a
response to points 1 and 2 as above.

NSW Fair Trading is seeking a response to the above by reply email by
Friday 6 August 2019. Should you wish to discuss this matter further I may
be contacted on 0436 655 187.

We are not able the let the pipe go through the two partition holes which were given beside the sink area.

Could you please send some one to have a look at it and make a little bigger space, so that the pipe which has small motor can go through.

Thanks for your email.

The connection to washing machine is not a maintenance issuse. 

To connect the washing machine hose, you need to remove the cap on the valve by a spanner or any suitable tool. Before you remove the cap, make sure the switch is horizontal not vertical as the photo shown, to prevent water drop down when you loose the cap. 

You can call your friend with the tools to help or get the tool from Bunnings or hardware shop to do it yourself. Even you can pay a handyman to do that.

Hope the information helps.

We had a visit last Friday from a person who dismantled the dryer, but they werenât able to fix it and itâs now sitting on top of our washing machine. They said theyâd get back to you about it. Is there any update yet?

Thanks!

Hi Tony,

Â 

Sorry to bother so soon after moving in, but we tried to use the drier for the first time, and itâs not working... seems to just click without functioning in any way. Did you have any advice?

Subject: Re: Unit 28/20-24 Sorrell Street, PARRAMATTA - Electricity reimbursement

Dear Tony,

Greetings, Thanks for the update, see it is not the benefit from the landload and is an agreement.

I will explain better. The family energy benefit is for us and not for others to share. We received the benefit and not others. The agreement is to share 70% and 30% ratio. 

Ideally it should be 50% 50% sharing, the reason is - when we signed the agreement your associate said only one person living in 28A, but there are multiple people living and using the dryer, washing machine, and everythingÂ happens in electricity, we use gas for cooking, they are using electricity for everything including cooking. Keeping that aside.

If me and you travel in the train and if I receive a student benefit and if you don't you shouldn't be askingÂ to share my student benefit. If you really want to make clear then please add clearly in the agreement and advise customer in the first place. 

Please proceed for the reimbursement however you decide, and let us know once payment isÂ made

Let me know if anymore details needed on this

Thanks

Hi Jayakumar & Gajalakshmi,

Thank you for your email.

I am afraid is an unreasonable request to tell your landlord to pay the full amount.

The bill shows your payment is $773.88.

The landlord will reimburse 70% of your payment.

As you previous email that the NSW government already gave you the benefit.

You can not earn twice of the benefit from your landlord and the government.

Please confirm then we will proceed the reimbursement.

Hope the information assists and have a nice day!

Thanks Tony, We are receiving family tax benefit and that is execlusively for the family not to share with others, would you like to share with others, it is not the discount from the electricity provider and is from the NSW government for the family. We are not asking the discounts what energy provider provides, hope it makes sense.

Otherwise please let me know, it is completely unacceptable.

Please let me know if any more details needed on this.

Thanks Anh, all good with Samantha and Myself.

As we are relocating back to SA , can you ask the Owner if they would like for us to have leave the washing machine as is, It is only 20 months old and still looks and operates as brand new and it still has the stickers on as you will see. 

I have attached Photos and it's clean as new. The cost to relocate it to SA would be better utilised to just buy a new one in SA once we arrive.

So if theÂ Owner wouldÂ like it left in the unit, we are happy to do so free of charge . it just is one less hassle for us and we have enjoyed the unit so it may be a win/win for both parties.

Let me know the outcome , many thanks .

Iâve scheduled your outgoing inspection to be conducted 11:00AM Monday 16/08/2021. We prefer both parties are on site to finalise the condition and bond.

We suggest to tenant extend the utilities service such as electricity and gas for 2 days in order to have all relevant item can be checkout on the outgoing inspection, or for the tradesman to rectify the item if any outstanding condition required to be rectified. Please note, your bond release can be delayed if the items are not rectified upon outgoing inspection.

In the meantime, we will carry out the open inspection to obtain the new tenant, we will inform you for the open inspection time beforehand. Generally, open inspections will take up only 15 minutes of your time on a weekday afternoon and Saturday morning. My colleagues and Iâll ensure all attendees are carefully monitored and cause minimal disturbance to you and your property.

Your landlord would like to thank you in advance for the cooperation.

Just finally, please provide a brief reason why your vacating, if youâre considering alternate rental accommodation throughout the greater Sydney, please refer https://www.pia.com.au/en/rent-property/ for a list of our currently available properties.

Hey nguyen

Thanks for the email. There are a few things like washing machine and fridge etc and the rest I can happily chuck out and give the place a good clean. Also with payment my tax is still coming through which I am waiting for.

Also what day is the tribunal as I do not want to miss it again

Thankyou

I met your house mate and also help him to install the washing machine. 

Also I explained to him what is the problem from the washing machine.

My recommend, if you are not sure to install the washing machine, you should ask assistant from technician. If you want us to send technician to install washing machine for you, the service fee will be charged on you. 

The time I was there, it no leakage from washing tap, the leakage by misuse or incorrect to install washing machine.

As we are relocating back to SA , can you ask the Owner if they would like for us to have leave the washing machine as is, It is only 20 months old and still looks and operates as brand new and it still has the stickers on as you will see. 

I have attached Photos and it's clean as new. The cost to relocate it to SA would be better utilised to just buy a new one in SA once we arrive.

So if theÂ Owner wouldÂ like it left in the unit, we are happy to do so free of charge . it just is one less hassle for us and we have enjoyed the unit so it may be a win/win for both parties.

Let me know the outcome , many thanks .

Iâve scheduled your outgoing inspection to be conducted 11:00AM Monday 16/08/2021. We prefer both parties are on site to finalise the condition and bond.

We suggest to tenant extend the utilities service such as electricity and gas for 2 days in order to have all relevant item can be checkout on the outgoing inspection, or for the tradesman to rectify the item if any outstanding condition required to be rectified. Please note, your bond release can be delayed if the items are not rectified upon outgoing inspection.

In the meantime, we will carry out the open inspection to obtain the new tenant, we will inform you for the open inspection time beforehand. Generally, open inspections will take up only 15 minutes of your time on a weekday afternoon and Saturday morning. My colleagues and Iâll ensure all attendees are carefully monitored and cause minimal disturbance to you and your property.

Your landlord would like to thank you in advance for the cooperation.

Just finally, please provide a brief reason why your vacating, if youâre considering alternate rental accommodation throughout the greater Sydney, please refer https://www.pia.com.au/en/rent-property/ for a list of our currently available properties.

Hope this information assists.

Have a great week!

Hello Hatem,

Thank you for the email.

Just got off a call with the owner.

Pleased to inform that I have an approval from the owner to send in Stove Doctor to check on the issue.

However, before Stove Doctor comes to check, I would suggest you to pull out the dishwasher to check if the outlet drain pipe is bent. The reason for asking you to do this is because the user manual says water does not drain if the filter is not clean (which is not the case here) or there is a bend/ kink in the outlet drain pipe.

While the work order has already been issued to Stove Doctor, if the issue is found to be operational in nature, you would be liable to pay the charges (approx. $300.00).

Just a follow up on the wet carpet issue.

At the moment I'm trying not to use the tap or washing machine and dish washer.

The carpet is still very very wet and I'm doing alot to keep it under control. But there is only so much I can do. Obviously mould at this stage is now a probability and a major issue and in my opinion we might need to cut the whole carpet out and replace it for health reasons. Testing would be required. 

Please contact me as soon as possible it's been almost a week since I emailed about this

I have received the email below along with the attached photo from Rahul, resident of Unit 127. He moved in on 31.03.2021 and connected his washing machine but it seems the common drain is blocked.

Request to kindly advise if this will be addressed by strata or is this in the lot onwerâs scope of maintenance.

Best regards,

Thank you for the email.

While I have written to appliance repairers to seek their inputs and
quotations for owner's review and approval, I have also attached the user
manual for your reference.

From your email, it seems the dishwasher drain is clogged with some items.
The same is mentioned in the user manual (page 11).

Before the owner sends someone to check, may I request you to clean the
dishwasher filter and drain pipe which is the most common cause of
dishwasher not draining. You can pour some baking soda and after a few
second, pour warm water to try and remove any unclogging. You can also use
Draino Crystals which is easily available in stores including Bunnings.
Please let me know if the issue still persists.

Please note if a repairer attends to the issue to find the problem being
on account of operational issue, the cost of repair is charged to the
tenant. I would want to avoid such a situation at the first instance.

Request to please follow the instructions as per the manual and kindly
advise.

Trust you are well.

Further to our discussion yesterday during and after the final inspection, I am pleased to inform you that the cleaning was properly done and all keys have been returned.

As informed, since I did not find the ingoing condition report on the system, neither in the folder of documents related to your tenancy, the following discrepancies have been found. You informed that you had a discussion with Eddie that since there was nothing to report, will be fine to not send the report and Eddie said Yes.

- 2 small burn marks in the bedroom carpet (I have attached image 0568 from the ingoing photos and images 5719 and 5721 from the inspection yesterday for comparison)

- Condensation on cook top (image 0495 from ingoing photos and image 5733 from yesterday for comparison)

- Filter of kitchen sink missing (image 0499 from ingoing photos and image 5730 from yesterday for comparison â already discussed with you and Bharathi on what should be done)

- Rubber mark on kitchen benchtop (IMG 5735)

The water usage bill is paid till 05.07.2019 (copy of bill attached with meter reading as 148 units). I have attached the water meter reading taken yesterday (IMG 5666) showing the reading was 169.395 units, i.e. additional 21.395 units. Rate per unit is $2.11 per unit, which translates to $45.14 as final water usage charges for the unit for the period of 05/07/2019 â 29/10/2019.

Additionally, I checked all correspondences regarding the issuance of FoB and found that the owner paid for the extra FoB and had personally delivered it in the letter box (email attached). I have also attached the copy of the bill payment to strata as well as your ledger wherein, no additional amount was paid by you.

As informed by you and Bharathi yesterday, you paid an amount of $100.00 and were informed by Eddie that this amount will be refunded to you when you vacate the unit. You also informed that you purchased the washing machine and the furniture for $300.00 from the previous tenant who was staying in the unit.

I am preparing the report for the owner as well as I need to inform her of the final inspection.

Eddie â please advise on the FoB payment and reimbursement as has been informed by Adarsh as wella s the comment on igoing condition report.

Trust you are well.

This is with reference to the washing machine in the storage cage of Unit 41. Please find attached the email I had written to Rahul after speaking to the then building manager (Arif was the relief manager while Nasir was on holiday).

As you are aware, the storage cages were numbered as per the strata plan only at the beginning of this year and tenants were allocated whichever storage cage was empty by the building manager (you can verify this information with other tenants in the complex as well).

I was informed that a notice will be put up and if no one reverts, the items will be disposed off. I believe there was a circular also that was circulated to this effect.

However, it seems this hasnât been done.

Could you please re-check and have this addressed at the earliest?

Subject: Unit 27/13-19 Seven Hills Road, Baulkham Hills - dishwasher not working 

Hello Eric,

Trust you are well.

The tenant of your subject property reported that the dishwasher is not working and is showing and error, with water cycles not taking place.

We had shared the user manual to the tenant to check if everything is in order, but the problem still persists.

The tenant has informed that the dishwasher still doesn't work and so we need to repair the same.

I have the following quotes that I had obtained for repair of the dishwasher at another unit in the same complex:

- D'Angelo Trading: Call out fees of $150.00+GST. Assessment on site post which price will be shared, subject to repairs.

- Westinghouse: Call out fee of $150.00+GST. Cost subject to repairs and parts.

- Stove Doctor: can inspect and repair on site within a blanket approval of $285.00 including GST (including service call out fee, parts, labour and 1 year warranty). If repair expense is more than $285.00, they will advise on total cost for approval before going ahead (including replacement options if required).

Given that the dishwasher repair is to be treated as an urgent issue, kindly advise if we should issue a job order to Stove Doctor. Alternatively, if you have any vendor who can attend and repair the dishwasher, please pass on the details for us to co-ordinate the access with the tenant.

Look forward to your inputs on the above.

Dear Mr Wang

Reference is made to correspondence received from Ms Yuyu Zheng regarding her previous tenancy at 14/1 Defries Avenue, Zetland<https://www.google.com/maps/search/14%2F1+Defries+Avenue,+Zetland?entry=gmail&amp;source=g>.

Ms Zheng has advised NSW Fair Trading that:
- she attended the outgoing inspection at the property and was advised by a representative of your agency that the Landlord was seeking she purchase a new dish washing machine 
- she acknowledges the outer cover of the machine was damaged during her tenancy 
- she notes the machine is 7-8 years old and remains fully functional
- she is willing to compensate the Landlord for the fair value of the damage to the outer cover but believes it is unreasonable that she is required to pay for a brand new machine

It has been confirmed to Ms Zheng that your agency submitted a claim for the refund of the rental bond at the property (P290408-0, refund $1939.00 Managing Agent, refund $141.00 Tenant) which becomes payable on 5/9/2019 if not disputed. Ms Zheng has flagged her intention to ?freeze? this claim. 

Ms Zheng has advised NSW Fair Trading she is seeking:
- the Landlord agree to returning her the balance of the bond for the tenancy, less $300.00 to compensate the Landlord for the fair value of the damage to the outer cover of the dishwasher 

In order to progress this matter further, NSW Fair Trading is seeking:
1) a response from the Landlord in regards to Ms Zheng?s desired outcome?
2) confirmation and a copy of supporting documentation that your agency provided Ms Zheng with the documentation required under Section 165 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2015 within 7 days of the bond claim being made?

Please be advised that in this instance, whilst you are welcome to provide any further supporting documentation, NSW Fair Trading is only seek a response to points 1 and 2 as above. 

NSW Fair Trading is seeking a response to the above by reply email by Friday 6 August 2019. Should you wish to discuss this matter further I may be contacted on 0436 655 187.

Hi
Iris,

Thank
you for answering my call this morning.

As
for the bond claim in the previous tenant's case, we have kept all
communication in oral. I am writing this email to get written confirmation from
you for Fair Trading's investigation on us.

Upon
final inspection with the tenant, she confirmed she had damaged the dishwasher
panel. Under your oral instructions, we have requested the tenants to repair
the damaged panel.

However,
the tenant said she couldn't get it fixed, and we have also consulted with the
appliance repair company that they advised the panel is not economical for
repair.

As a
result, we enquired your instructions on this case and confirmed the tenant is
required to either get the panel fixed or replace the panel.

Since
the tenant is unwilling to take effort to get the panel fixed or replaced, we
asked a replacement quote for the dishwasher at cheapest $499 and asked you
whether you agree to deduct this amount from the tenant's bond as a
repair/replacement equivalent cost to you. The answer we got from you is
positive. Thus we claimed this amount of $499 from the tenant's bond.

Â 

Please
kindly review the above fact statement and let me know whether you agree with
the above facts. Please confirm we have kept you informed of the processes and
acted under your instructions.

If
you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear Mr Wang

Reference is made to correspondence received from Ms Yuyu Zheng regarding her previous tenancy at 14/1 Defries Avenue, Zetland<https://www.google.com/maps/search/14%2F1+Defries+Avenue,+Zetland?entry=gmail&amp;source=g>.

Ms Zheng has advised NSW Fair Trading that:
- she attended the outgoing inspection at the property and was advised by a representative of your agency that the Landlord was seeking she purchase a new dish washing machine 
- she acknowledges the outer cover of the machine was damaged during her tenancy 
- she notes the machine is 7-8 years old and remains fully functional
- she is willing to compensate the Landlord for the fair value of the damage to the outer cover but believes it is unreasonable that she is required to pay for a brand new machine

It has been confirmed to Ms Zheng that your agency submitted a claim for the refund of the rental bond at the property (P290408-0, refund $1939.00 Managing Agent, refund $141.00 Tenant) which becomes payable on 5/9/2019 if not disputed. Ms Zheng has flagged her intention to ?freeze? this claim. 

Ms Zheng has advised NSW Fair Trading she is seeking:
- the Landlord agree to returning her the balance of the bond for the tenancy, less $300.00 to compensate the Landlord for the fair value of the damage to the outer cover of the dishwasher 

In order to progress this matter further, NSW Fair Trading is seeking:
1) a response from the Landlord in regards to Ms Zheng?s desired outcome?
2) confirmation and a copy of supporting documentation that your agency provided Ms Zheng with the documentation required under Section 165 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2015 within 7 days of the bond claim being made?

Please be advised that in this instance, whilst you are welcome to provide any further supporting documentation, NSW Fair Trading is only seek a response to points 1 and 2 as above. 

NSW Fair Trading is seeking a response to the above by reply email by Friday 6 August 2019. Should you wish to discuss this matter further I may be contacted on 0436 655 187.

Yours Sincerely

Thank you for the email Rahul,

I have sought inputs from Strata and Building Management regarding whether this is in their scope or the owner.

In the meanwhile, I have already sought quotations from plumbers to share it with owner for approval should the strata not be liable.

We have received the plumberâs report from Strata stating the leakage was happening due to broken hose pipe of the washing machine. This, if true, would entail that the plumberâs invoice shall be passed on to you for payment.

Hello Pranav,

Â 

Can you send me a short video to show what is happening? Where is the leakage coming from â is it the outlet pipe?

Â 

Copying Nasir as well.

Â 

Nasir bhai â are you at the site today? Would you be able to check on the issue?

Hello Cathy,

Trust you are well.

I have received the email below along with the attached photo from Rahul, resident of Unit 127. He moved in on 31.03.2021 and connected his washing machine but it seems the common drain is blocked.

Request to kindly advise if this will be addressed by strata or is this in the lot onwerâs scope of maintenance.

Hello Hatem,

Â 

Thank you for the email.

Â 

Just got off a call with the owner.

Â 

Pleased to inform that I have an approval from the owner to send in Stove Doctor to check on the issue.

Â 

However, before Stove Doctor comes to check, I would suggest you to pull out the dishwasher to check if the outlet drain pipe is bent. The reason for asking you to do this is because the user manual says water does not drain if the filter is not clean (which is not the case here) or there is a bend/ kink in the outlet drain pipe.

Â 

While the work order has already been issued to Stove Doctor, if the issue is found to be operational in nature, you would be liable to pay the charges (approx. $300.00).

I have tried to pull out the dishwashing machine to check if the outlet drain pipe is bend - but I couldnât pull it out fully from the box to check the outlet drain pipe (seems that the pipe length is short) - in order to do so, I need to release the pipe from its point under the sink so I can pull it out in full - but I wonât do so unless you want me to do so.Â 

Anyway I have been contacted bu Stove doctor and they should come on Friday.

Sorry for not being able to take your calls.

The owner has instructed WPS Plumbing to check on the leakage and advise. Your contact details have been shared with the Plumber to contact you for an appointment.

Point of contact at WPS is Wael and can be contacted on 0420 909 690.

Â 

Hello Eric,

Trust you are well.

The tenant of your subject property reported that the dishwasher is not working and is showing and error, with water cycles not taking place.

We had shared the user manual to the tenant to check if everything is in order, but the problem still persists.

The tenant has informed that the dishwasher still doesn't work and so we need to repair the same.

I have the following quotes that I had obtained for repair of the dishwasher at another unit in the same complex:

- D'Angelo Trading: Call out fees of $150.00+GST. Assessment on site post which price will be shared, subject to repairs.

- Westinghouse: Call out fee of $150.00+GST. Cost subject to repairs and parts.

- Stove Doctor: can inspect and repair on site within a blanket approval of $285.00 including GST (including service call out fee, parts, labour and 1 year warranty). If repair expense is more than $285.00, they will advise on total cost for approval before going ahead (including replacement options if required).

Given that the dishwasher repair is to be treated as an urgent issue, kindly advise if we should issue a job order to Stove Doctor. Alternatively, if you have any vendor who can attend and repair the dishwasher, please pass on the details for us to co-ordinate the access with the tenant.

Look forward to your inputs on the above.

Hello Eric,

Â 

Please find attached the extract on definition of repairs as per the Fair Trading as well as clause 19 (19 b â points a to k define urgent repairs) of the tenancy agreement. It is an urgent repair as defined.

Â 

I believe the name and number you have shared is for Peter Lee from ASP Way Co. Happy to speak to him.

Â 

All quotations provided in my earlier email are for appliance repairers. If you want, we can check with more handymen for comparable quotes as well.

Â 

Kindly advise.

Subject: Unit 27/13-19 Seven Hills Road, Baulkham Hills - dishwasher not working 

Â 

Hello Eric,

Trust you are well.

The tenant of your subject property reported that the dishwasher is not working and is showing and error, with water cycles not taking place.

We had shared the user manual to the tenant to check if everything is in order, but the problem still persists.

The tenant has informed that the dishwasher still doesn't work and so we need to repair the same.

I have the following quotes that I had obtained for repair of the dishwasher at another unit in the same complex:

- D'Angelo Trading: Call out fees of $150.00+GST. Assessment on site post which price will be shared, subject to repairs.

- Westinghouse: Call out fee of $150.00+GST. Cost subject to repairs and parts.

- Stove Doctor: can inspect and repair on site within a blanket approval of $285.00 including GST (including service call out fee, parts, labour and 1 year warranty). If repair expense is more than $285.00, they will advise on total cost for approval before going ahead (including replacement options if required).

Given that the dishwasher repair is to be treated as an urgent issue, kindly advise if we should issue a job order to Stove Doctor. Alternatively, if you have any vendor who can attend and repair the dishwasher, please pass on the details for us to co-ordinate the access with the tenant.

Look forward to your inputs on the above.

Kind Regards,

Biplav Dutta

Received an email from the tenant of your subject property informing that the dishwasher has stopped working, the same issue as earlier this year for which you had advised Peter from ASP Way Co. to attend.

Â 

The tenant has informed that when he starts the dishwasher and set up the program, the light flashes 4 times and nothing else happens.

Â 

May I request to kindly advise if Peter can be sent again to have a look at the dishwasher?

Â 

âAn appliance is broken so that a substantial amount of water is wastedâ Â the key of this definition is â âthe broke lead to a substantial water is wasted â( it may water save without using it). The washing machine Â broken is a fact but it may not lead a substantial water wasted. So it cannot treat as urgent repair for my understanding. 

Â 

If Peter inspect it as broken and I would rather replace a new one then. 

Â 

Thank you

ï»¿Hi Matt,

1. Plumbing problem-He is trying to put some liquid into drain hole and I will let you know if it does not work after a day or two. Â He said we will need a plumber if his method does not work.

2. Intercom issue - No sound coming from main entrance intercom- Both Hany from Strata and owner checked the issue and owner asked me to talk to so you can organize a fix.

Sound coming from Second entrance properly so I assume that cable or connection between the intercom in my unit and the main entrance intercom has some problem. 

3. Weak exhaust fan issue-The owener is well aware that it is weak but he wanted to talk about it later.

Kind Regards,
Wonjoon Kim

Hi Andy.

Â 

My bad, I was referringÂ to theÂ  dishwasher. I can record a video, however the problem is that the dishwasher didn'tÂ finish its cleaning cycle. So it remainedÂ on for a long time (hours )Â  and didn't finish the cleaning process.Â

ï»¿Hi
Miki,Â 

Â 

First
of all, I never received any communication today from any party regarding the
inspection of the premises. In fact you contacted Lorna who is not even in the
state. So if you wanted action to be taken promptly then you should have
informed both of us tenants. Since you didnât inform me you have left too short
notice that I canât possibly make it at those times as I am a working
professional. This is both unfair and unreasonable.Â 

Â 

Also
I would like to add that we left the apartment in a very clean state. As per
the NSW guidelines for rental tenancy, it states that the residence must be
âreasonably cleanâ. Can you please indicate what part of leaving cleaning
products in the cupboard or a sock in the washing machine leaves it
unreasonably clean?Â 

<image0.png>

Â 

We
have been nothing but good tenants, caused no problems and have been very
respectful of the property. I am very disappointed Â that you are trying to
take money off us for something that is not our responsibility and you are not
giving us a suitable chance to rectify the problem. I have no problem disputing
this with you.

Â 

Also
I would like to add that we have left the apartment in the very state it was
given to us. It was certainly not professionally cleaned and so we have cleaned
it to a standard that it was when we begun our lease. We have cleaned
adequately and do not appreciate that you are trying to charge us $450 dollars
for a sock in the washing machine and some cleaning products in the cupboard
when we were not given the same courtesy when we moved in. In fact there were
reminants of the previous tenant even when we moved in.Â 

Â 

I
would like to discuss this further with you please contact me on
0491947830.Â

these are pre-existed conditions that need to be fixed urgently.

we mentioned the water is going very slow in bathrokms in the condition report.

as for the waste hose, there is no way we caused it either.

its not securely installed at all, hanging in the middle of air, we did not know about it. the first time we used our washing machine, all the waste water overflows to the floor and we had to buy a carpet cleaning machine to get rid of all the water soaked in the carpet.

Hi Minhua Liao; Siwei Wu,

For your update, a work order has just been sent to the assigned tradesman.

Zein will contact you shortly to attend the issue.

For your information, ZeinÂ can be reached on 0429542444, and email address is info@alliancelc.com.au<mailto:info@alliancelc.com.au>.

If you do not hear from anyone whoâs been instructed in a timely manner, please notify me to follow up.

Once again, once the tradesman attends only to find misuse/damage caused by the user rather than a fault with the item/matter, I am afraid that the tenant will be liable for any associated charges.

In the meantime, thank you for your patience.

Â 

Hi strata team,

Â 

Hope this email finds you well.

Â 

It has been brought to my attention recently that your strata policy has detailed that we can only be allowed to move in/out during a weekday. As I was not aware of this previously, I have organised my schedule for the move to happen this weekend.

Â 

I am requesting permission to be allowed to move out this weekend due to work and other various reasons and hope the team can make an exception for us.

Â 

To explain our situation better, here are some points to why and some further information regarding the move.

Â 

*	I do work I full time job and during this time of the year it is quite busy.
*	With the busy season, it will be hard to organise a time in short notice.
*	On Monday the 24/05, I will be going into surgery for a shoulder reconstruction therefore anything after that date will be difficult on myself and my partner
*	The reason that we are moving, is that we have secured a new home, we will be settling on the Friday, 21/05. Of course we do need to consider cleaning the place first before we start the move on the following day.
*	We have already put in a termination date with the agent as we our currently renting.
*	We actually donât have that much big appliances, again we are in a 1 bedroom apartment, so as far as big appliances, fridge, washing machine, and the rest is just furniture.

Â 

Further information/proof can be provided, and you can contact me on 0422 201 088.

Â 

Thank you for your consideration and hope to hear back from you soon.

Â 

Regards,
Jason

Subject: Requesting permission to move out - 22-23/05/2021

Â 

Hi strata team,

Â 

Hope this email finds you well.

Â 

It has been brought to my attention recently that your strata policy has detailed that we can only be allowed to move in/out during a weekday. As I was not aware of this previously, I have organised my schedule for the move to happen this weekend.

Â 

I am requesting permission to be allowed to move out this weekend due to work and other various reasons and hope the team can make an exception for us.

Â 

To explain our situation better, here are some points to why and some further information regarding the move.

Â 

*	I do work I full time job and during this time of the year it is quite busy.
*	With the busy season, it will be hard to organise a time in short notice.
*	On Monday the 24/05, I will be going into surgery for a shoulder reconstruction therefore anything after that date will be difficult on myself and my partner
*	The reason that we are moving, is that we have secured a new home, we will be settling on the Friday, 21/05. Of course we do need to consider cleaning the place first before we start the move on the following day.
*	We have already put in a termination date with the agent as we our currently renting.
*	We actually donât have that much big appliances, again we are in a 1 bedroom apartment, so as far as big appliances, fridge, washing machine, and the rest is just furniture.

Â 

Further information/proof can be provided, and you can contact me on 0422 201 088.

Â 

Thank you for your consideration and hope to hear back from you soon.

Â 

Regards,
Jason

Â 

The committee has reviewed application by Unit 103 tenants to move out this weekend, with the below condition:

Â 

Limit moving large size items within 6 hours and use the lift curtain protected lift only, so as to minimize disturbing other residents in the complex. The tenant can still have plenty of time to move other handy items. 

Strictly comply with other requirement set out in the moving guide. 

In the event of any unforeseeable things happen, contact building manager immediately. Any after hour surcharge will be charged back. 

Â 

Hi Tusitha, 

Â 

Please organise the lift curtain to be put up and let Jason know which one to use. 

Â 

Thank you.

Hi Chuhan,

Â 

Thanks for your email. 

Have you tried to clean up the bottom or the out water pipe in the dishwasher? We have many similar case of the dishwashers which is mainly resulted by food blockage. 

We can get a technician to come and fix the problem. However, if they find out the cause is due to food blockage, the tenant will be responsible for the repair cost. 

Would you like to try from your side to avoid potential cost from your side? 

Â 

Kind regards,

ï»¿Hello Mew, 

Â 

Thank you for your information.

Â I would like to ask whether you received the email in relation to our request on the manual of the dishwashing machine early this month?

Â 

Can you kindly provide us with the full electric manual then we can make sure we manipulate it correctly, before you send out your tradesman?Â 

Â 

Without the manual we cannot tell whether the issue is with us or in the machine itself.Â 

Â 

Thank you

Â 

Regards

Hi Chuhan Wu; Qian Sun,

Hope allâs well.

For your update, we have submitted your maintenance request to the landlord with quotations for seeking their consideration and approval.

For your information, once the tradesman attends only to find misuse/damage rather than a fault with the unit/s, youâll be liable for any associated charges.

Thank you for your continuous patience.

Dear Jeffrey,

Â 

The dishwasher is not working properly (please see attached). The water was not completely pumped out after the usage. Can you please arrange someone to fix this issue?

Â 

Please contact me @0415 188 566 if you need further information.

Â 

Many thanks,

Â 

Chuhan Wu

Hey Tom,

Thanks you for sorting that out so fast. I just wanted to double check something. So it's the dishwasher that makes the power in the kitchen shut down. You guys are sending stove doctor and not an electrician. Is that correct, not sure if it should be an electrician?

Thanks,

Hey guys, 

Now that we are out of lockdown can someone pls come & have a look at the diswasher machine? When we try to use it the power switches in the kitchen will flip & turn off. And so we havenât been able to use the dishwasher at all.

Hi Feng,

Hope you are well.Â 

The tenant ofÂ Unit 1008/208 Coward St, MASCOTÂ  reported to us that the washing machine is stop working.Â  It is not worth to repair and better leave it as not washing machine for next tenant to avoidÂ further maintenanceÂ 

Therefore, I will advise to give $200.00 rent credit to remove the machine and tenant could get the new washing machine from their own and when they leave the property, they could take it with them.Â 

Please kindly let me know is this option more suitable for you then replace the new washing machineÂ for them?

Â 

The plumber looked
at the leaking water under washing machine, and told us that itâs not a
plumbing issue, the washing machine is leaking.Â 

And now the washing

Therefore, I will convince her to give $200.00 rent credit to remove the machine and you could get the new washing machine from your own and when you leave the property, you could take it with you.Â 

Please kindly let me know it this option more suitable for you?

HiÂ Ivy,Â 

Â 

The plumber looked
at the leaking water under washing machine, and told us that itâs not a
plumbing issue, the washing machine is leaking.Â 

And now the washing
machine has completely stopped working.Â 

Â 

Can you arrange
someone to repair the washing machine?Â 

Â 

And if it could be
fixed as soon as possible,Â that would be great.Â

Thank you for meeting with me today, I want to say I spent so many hours cleaning the unit for the handover, there is normal wear and tear and scuff marks which I tried to remove but wasnât able to, I did my best and Iâm so stressed over this as I donât think I could of done anything more.

Please relay to the owner I looked after their home and had to deal with multiple people and agents through my unit during my tenancy, I had a terrible time communicating with Vicki at PIA and was not able to get a resolution on certain issues.

1/ the washing machine and dryer would not work together without cutting the electricity out.

2/ the microwave and jug would not work together also cutting electricity out

3/ eve internet is a poor connection and had so much trouble with Orccon to connect me.

I understand and accept $18 for vacuuming the floor which was more than likely from me cleaning and would really appreciate my refund of the bond.

The owner has since rented the unit again for a much higher amount of $580 and my arrears of rent will all be paid from my bond, leaving me with a refund of $600 or so which I desperately need.

I donât want to have to go tribunal as this is so stressful.

Thank you

Hi Ivy,

Please note that a pest control at the unit has been arranged on Tuesday 26 April 2022 4pm-5pm. I will need to pay him as well. Could you please liaise with the tenant such that the pest control can take place.

I also would like to arrange a precautionary checkup at the same time (Tuesday 26 April 2022 4pm-5pm), with the drainage for both the washing machine and the dishwasher - as I only had time to do a quick test with these 2 appliances on the rubber seal at the drainage ONLY ONCE before they moved in.

The second request may seem unusual but I didn't have enough time to do a thorough check on this crucial item and certainly do not want this to be an expensive repair if we find this out too late. It's very simple yet critical. Please find the photo attached for the parts I am referring to.

You are welcome to call me on 0467 532 136 to clarify the items if there are anything unclear, thank you.

Confirming I will attend the appointment on the 21st April @5:30pm at your Sydney Olympic Park office. 

Â 

Can you please generate a rental bonds online submission link for me to submit my bond?

Â 

Please advise if you require any further payments. You said you required two weeks Â rent ($580 x 2 = $1,160) plus the bond ($2,320) totalling $3,480

Â 

Attached receipts total that amount $3,480 so please confirm you have received cleared funds and everything else required?

Iâd also like to arrange your banking details to organise the rent to be paid but Iâm guessing this will be organised on the 21st when I arrive?

The tenant ofÂ Unit 1008/208 Coward St, MASCOT reported to us that the washing machine is stop working. It is not worth to repair and better leave it as not washing machine for next tenant to avoidÂ further maintenance 

Therefore, I will advise to give $200.00 rent credit to remove the machine and tenant could get the new washing machine from their own and when they leave the property, they could take it with them.

Hi Ivy,

Hope you're doingÂ well! 

There are a couple of things, which we need your help to fix. 

*	The dryer switch is not working (out of two switches, only one of them is working). It's difficult to use both the washing machine and dryer at theÂ same time. 
*	The dishwasher isn't turning on (the switchÂ is on condition only). We never turned on it before. Now we are trying but no luck.

May I request you please check with the landlord and send a technicianÂ to fix both of the things? Please let me know If you haveÂ any questions.

Hi Ivy,

Hope you are fine,

Regarding the email, I did not exactly understand which units or buildings are sub station 1 and which sub station 2 ??

It is really difficult having no power, cold water. No shower, no internet, no washing machine no air conditioning and nothing in general, so itâs difficult to stay in unit while there is no power. parking is still in water, lots of rubbish in front of building and the strata even donât bother to put some kind of light in the stairs or parking!!

Would you please advise meaning of station 1&2.

Hi Alex,

Due to family
exigency at home, Iâm travelling to India today morning. Khushbu will sign the
lease today and take the keys. I authorise her to sign on my behalf. I will
sign the lease if required on my return.Â 

Â 

As you have
received 2 weeks rental payment and rental bond, I believe there shouldnât be a
problem. Appreciate your understanding and look forward to meeting you in our

Hello Ivy,

Hope you are well. It's been a while we talked.

I am emailing you now as we need to get few electrical and plumbing issues sorted out. There are couple of plug sockets and switches that needs to be replaced/repaired and we would also need someone to look at the water connection to the washing machine. I have attached some photos as well. 

It would be great if you can send someone to help with this.

Hope
you and your family are very well. 

The
tenant has reported below maintenance issue require attention & action:

Â Electrical IssuesÂ -""tenant mentioned:Â Upon returning home this evening I have went to
turn the air conditioning inÂ the lounge room on, and it has not turned on. This is the same airÂ conditioning that had this issue in the past. Though The air conditioner inÂ the main room is still working. Also Iâve gone to put washing on as I have gone to flip the switch on and it is not flipping on. I attempted to use the separateÂ switch and is also not flipping on and no power is coming to the plugged in washing machine and dryer. I have checked the power box that is located in the main room wardrobe and all the switches are on. So I am wondering if there is a electrical fault in the unit. I find this strange because both of these issues where not present in the unit yesterday. Can you please get back to me as soon as possible about this electrical issue. I am best contacted through this email due to working hours""

Â 

In
order to resolve this issue, please find out the attached quotations for your consideration,

(Quotation
may vary subject to the tradesman inspection)

1.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Polygon Electrical Pty Ltd, Richard: 0402369887Â -
Quoted inspect electrical issue at above unit is $120Â +
any materials + GST. If issue is within internal of air con unit, it will require
air con repair trademan to attend.

2.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Steven HlentzosÂ Â -
Quoted $300.00Â With this request, it is unclear at this point what the
issue may be. It could take up to 4 hours for faulting and repairing the issue.
In this case I would allow $300. The final price may be less although this
should be worst case scenario to fault find the issue. This does not include
any repairs of the air conditioner if the air conditioner has a problem.Â 

3.Â  Â  Â  Â  Ausgeneral Pty Ltd JerryÂ Â -
Quoted $220.00 inc GST to repair the above mentioned issues.Â 

Our
recommendation is to chooseÂ  Ausgeneral Pty LtdÂ for the reasons of most competitive price and quality service previously been
provided.

If
you have alternative option or your preferred tradesman, please do not hesitate
to notify us and we can liaise the associated parties further.

In the meantime, we will NOT
take further action without your instruction & approval.

Hi Ivy,
Upon returning home this evening I have went to turn the air conditioning in
the lounge room on, and it has not turned on. This is the same air
conditioning that had this issue in the past. Though The air conditioner in
the main room is still working.
Also Iâve gone to put washing on as I have gone to flip the switch on and it
is not flipping on. I attempted to use the seperate switch and is also not
flipping on and no power is coming to the plugged in washing machine and
dryer. I have checked the power box that is located in the main room
wardrobe and all the switches are on.
So I am wondering if there is a electrical fault in the unit. I find this
strange because both of these issues where not present in the unit
yesterday.
Can you please get back to me as soon as possible about this electrical
issue.
I am best contacted through this email due to working hours.

Regards,
Denea Luck.

Subject: Unit 114/36 Cowper St, PARRAMATTA - Air conditioning is not connected 

Hi Aris and Paul

Hope you are doing well.

The air conditioning technician attended and checked the air conditioningÂ issue forÂ Unit 114/36 Cowper St, PARRAMATTA NSW 2150, he found out that the air conditioning does not connected to the master bedroom. The reason as below: One of the decuts has been blocked. RequestÂ : Cut the hole to get access to fix the ceiling.

But before we carry out the repair, we will like to confirm with you for the strata by law. The service panel is in the ceilingÂ and it is strata's responsibility to repair the matter inside the ceiling. If I am wrong, please provide the strata by law to verify. 

Please view the below photo for your information. 

Tenant contact as below,

Sathish TamilselvanÂ 0423 159 272

I hope you're doing well!

From the conditional report we filled, we needed these things fixed:

1.	The two middle lights in the kitchen above the island needs to be fixed
2.	Bedroom 1's main bedroom light doesn't work - never worked before we moved in
3.	Bedroom 2's only has one bulb that works. (Picture included)Â 
4.	We bought a washing machine which is why we only realised a few days ago that one of the switches don't work. There was tape put on it - this restricts the use of both a dryer and washing machine. (Picture included)

Please provide the earliest date for which a handyman can come and fix these.

Thank you,Â

I donât see any issue with the power socket, itâs with dishwasher. I have tried to connect from extended power outlet, however itâs not turning on.

Also the dryer switch isnât working. Itâs difficult to use both washing machine and dryer at the same time.

May I request you to do the needful?

Hi Abdulrahim

Â 

It was nice talking to you today in visiting to inspect the power socket. Please talk to your real estate agent in regards to this as this required to be fixed by the owner. Building management is happy to organise an electrician to look at this if the real estate do not have a preferred contractor.

Hi Ivy,

Hope you are fine,

Regarding the email, I did not exactly understand which units or buildings are sub station 1 and which sub station 2 ??

It is really difficult having no power, cold water. No shower, no internet, no washing machine no air conditioning and nothing in general, so itâs difficult to stay in unit while there is no power. parking is still in water, lots of rubbish in front of building and the strata even donât bother to put some kind of light in the stairs or parking!!

Would you please advise meaning of station 1&2.Â

Hi Alex,

Trust youâre doing good.

With reference to your below email, I would like to inform you about our stand:

1.) We would like to sign the lease, take the keys and inspect the unit before we move in. Appreciate if you could meet us in the unit on a mutually agreeable date and time. I would propose Wednesday/Thursday evening or coming weekend as we both are working and itâs mid-week so it wonât be inconvenient for us in mornings. 

2.) Please share a link of fair trading where we will make the bond money transfer. I will transfer one week rent after we make the bond payment. Would be making all payments tomorrow. 

3.) Utility connections will be managed by us. Please ensure previous tenant disconnects all their connections.

4.) Kindly share building management contact details.

Hello Ivy,

Â 

Hope you are well. It's been a while we talked.

Â 

I am emailing you now as we need to get few electrical and plumbing issues sorted out. There are couple of plug sockets and switches that needs to be replaced/repaired and we would also need someone to look at the water connection to the washing machine. I have attached some photos as well.Â 

Â 

It would be great if you can send someone to help with this.

Hi Ivy,
Upon returning home this evening I have went to turn the air conditioning in
the lounge room on, and it has not turned on. This is the same air
conditioning that had this issue in the past. Though The air conditioner in
the main room is still working.
Also Iâve gone to put washing on as I have gone to flip the switch on and it
is not flipping on. I attempted to use the seperate switch and is also not
flipping on and no power is coming to the plugged in washing machine and
dryer. I have checked the power box that is located in the main room
wardrobe and all the switches are on.
So I am wondering if there is a electrical fault in the unit. I find this
strange because both of these issues where not present in the unit
yesterday.
Can you please get back to me as soon as possible about this electrical
issue.
I am best contacted through this email due to working hours.

Regards,
Denea Luck.

Subject: Unit 39, 54-62 Nijong Drive, Pemulwuy 2145. -Electrical Issues.

Hi Ivy,
Upon returning home this evening I have went to turn the air conditioning in
the lounge room on, and it has not turned on. This is the same air
conditioning that had this issue in the past. Though The air conditioner in
the main room is still working.
Also Iâve gone to put washing on as I have gone to flip the switch on and it
is not flipping on. I attempted to use the seperate switch and is also not
flipping on and no power is coming to the plugged in washing machine and
dryer. I have checked the power box that is located in the main room
wardrobe and all the switches are on.
So I am wondering if there is a electrical fault in the unit. I find this
strange because both of these issues where not present in the unit
yesterday.
Can you please get back to me as soon as possible about this electrical
issue.
I am best contacted through this email due to working hours.

Regards,
Denea Luck.

Thank you for your email. 

With this request, it is unclear at this point what the issue may be. It could take up to 4 hours for faulting and repairing the issue. In this case I would allow $300. The final price may be less although this should be worst case scenario to fault find the issue. This does not include any repairs of the air conditioner if the air conditioner has a problem. 

Thank you 

Kind regards, 

Steve

Hi Aris and Paul

Â 

Hope you are doing well.

The air conditioning technician attended and checked the air conditioningÂ issue forÂ Unit 114/36 Cowper St, PARRAMATTA NSW 2150, he found out that the air conditioning does not connected to the master bedroom. The reason as below: One of the decuts has been blocked. RequestÂ : Cut the hole to get access to fix the ceiling.

Â 

But before we carry out the repair, we will like to confirm with you for the strata by law.Â  The service panel is in the ceilingÂ and it is strata's responsibility to repair the matter inside the ceiling.Â Â If I am wrong, please provide the strata by law to verify.Â

Apologies for the late email. 

After still smelling gas from the pipe this evening Iâve followed the test whereby you put a small amount of soapy water to see if any bubbles form around the pipe, which would indicate a gas leak. Ive attached the video which does show that bubbles are forming and indicates a slight gas leak from the pipe, please confirm that this video has come through OK. 

I therefore request that a gas technician attends to the property to fix this as soon as possible, please let me know if I need to arrange? I think it should be an easy fix for them, but canât risk any gas leak in the property so really appreciate your and the Landlords helps to fix this promptly. 

I was wondering if at the same time the technician could fix the washing machine, since it is not filling with water sufficiently. I have checked that the water source is fully on and the water pressure Iâve also checked with no issue, so am needing help to resolve, and think it would be good if the same gas technician/plumber can resolve both at the same time. 

I apologise for raising these issues, normally I try to resolve myself (where possible). But given the nature of these issues, I appreciate your swift response to resolve. 

Best regards,
Alex

Dear Bowen

Â 

I tried running the washing machine yesterday, but it
doesn't spin! Â When I searched on the Internet, it was said that if there
are a lot of foreign substances in the water drain hole, dehydration will not
be possible. Â Call a washing machine repair shop! Â The brand is
Electrolux and the model name is EWW14912. Â If the repair is difficult,
take the washing machine and buy a new one!

Dear Bowen,

I hope this email finds you well.

Sorry to trouble you so late.

Could I request your help with my current situation with me vacating Unit 17, 1 Meryll Avenue, Baulkham Hills NSW 2153?

I have not been able to sell or donate any of my furniture: beds, tables, draws, etc, and or appliances: washing machine, fridge.

I need to vacate the unit before the 24th of December 2021.

Also, I plan to have the carpets and the unit cleaned before the new tenants move in.

However, I am intending to travel to Adelaide next Monday, 20th December 2021 via car in order to be back for my parents.

I would like to ask your assistance with how can I get rid of my furniture and or appliances by the end of this week?

Also, could you suggest or if you know of anyone via your company PIA who could help with this matter, as it is quite immediate?

Any assistance would greatly be appreciated.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerest appreciation.

Hi Bowen,

As discussed on the call, I have paid for the invoice since they needed to take payment immediately in order to complete the urgent repairs. They have fixed the gas leak and installed a replacement part. 

Please see attached the tax invoice and proof of payment for the $529.10 ($481 + GST). 

Therefore, no further payment to the plumbers needs to be made for this, since I have fully paid. 

The details for reimbursement to me are the same as for the carbon monoxide detector:

He should also say that the model is the Euromaid WM5PRO and the issue is that itâs not filling with enough water (possible water inlet valve issue).

Hi Bowen

Did the landlord also want the plumber to have a quick look at the washing machine at the same time? Thinking it might be something that they could fix possibly as I think itâs the water inlet valve, so May save on getting a replacement if they can look at it?

Hi Bowen,

As discussed on the call, I have paid for the invoice since they needed to take payment immediately in order to complete the urgent repairs. They have fixed the gas leak and installed a replacement part. 

Please see attached the tax invoice and proof of payment for the $529.10 ($481 + GST). 

Therefore, no further payment to the plumbers needs to be made for this, since I have fully paid. 

The details for reimbursement to me are the same as for the carbon monoxide detector:

BSB: 062004

Account number: 10523679

Unfortunately, he could not fix the washing machine so I request that the appropriate service technicianÂ attend to resolve the issue with the machine.

If you need anything else from me, please let me know.

Thank you again for your help.

Best regards,

Alex

Hi Bowen,

Thanks for this. Please can the landlord call the plumber to let them know about this issue and that heâs happy for them to look at it and repair if they can?

He should also say that the model is the Euromaid WM5PRO and the issue is that itâs not filling with enough water (possible water inlet valve issue). 

Let me know if I should call them to explain. 

Appreciate your help!

Hi Bowen

Did the landlord also want the plumber to have a quick look at the washing machine at the same time? Thinking it might be something that they could fix possibly as I think itâs the water inlet valve, so May save on getting a replacement if they can look at it?

Hi Bowen,

I hope you are well.

I've made the payment today for the next two weeks rent, so this should show your side in the next few days.

We just have a few of questions for you:

- we noticed there is a gas outlet pipe behind the sofa, is it possible for a Carbon monoxide alarm to be installed to ensure there is an alarm in place for safety? I'm happy to buy and install and be reimbursed for the cost of the alarm if that would work? I can see alarms in Bunnings for around $59 (Quell Worry-Free Carbon Monoxide Alarm - Bunnings Australia<https://www.bunnings.com.au/quell-worry-free-carbon-monoxide-alarm_p4211044?store=7313&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwkIGKBhCxARIsAINMioLok9tcBFKqpKXyzGL8gSNTi_lSrV4R1pNWkyJKvTaUQHrr6j4JKaQaApajEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds>), so please let me know if this is okay. Please can you confirm when this outlet was last serviced?

- the bedroom window is quite dirty and we can't reach to clean it, do you know if this is something that is managed by the Strata for the building? Is it possible to book a cleaning at all?

- the washing machine is sometimes a bit temperamentalÂ and is sometimes pausing and not starting the cycle, it does work after being reset and we are happy to carry on monitoring it for a bit, but just wanted to flag this

Please can you also provide the reference to us when the bond is lodged.

Thank you for your help.

I hope this email finds you well.

Sorry to trouble you so late.

Could I request your help with my current situation with me vacating Unit 17, 1 Meryll Avenue, Baulkham Hills NSW 2153?

I have not been able to sell or donate any of my furniture: beds, tables, draws, etc, and or appliances: washing machine, fridge.

I need to vacate the unit before the 24th of December 2021.

Also, I plan to have the carpets and the unit cleaned before the new tenants move in.

However, I am intending to travel to Adelaide next Monday, 20th December 2021 via car in order to be back for my parents.

I would like to ask your assistance with how can I get rid of my furniture and or appliances by the end of this week?

Also, could you suggest or if you know of anyone via your company PIA who could help with this matter, as it is quite immediate?

Any assistance would greatly be appreciated.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerest appreciation.

I just realised it would be great if you could tell us please about the landlord's plans before the handyman comes in. If they decide they are not coming to pick up the old washing machine in a week, then the handyman can take it out tomorrow as one job. Alex already checked with the building manager where we should leave it. 

Looking forward to your reply.

Many thanks,

Hi Bowen,

Thank you for arranging help to replace old washing machine with the new one.

Also, I just talked to Alex and we both agreed that if the landlord wants to keep and repair the old washing machine, could you please ask him to pick it up within a week? Otherwise, we will have to get rid of it due to the storage limitation. Appreciate your advice here.

Hi Bowen,

As discussed on the call, I have paid for the invoice since they needed to take payment immediately in order to complete the urgent repairs. They have fixed the gas leak and installed a replacement part.Â 

Please see attached the tax invoice and proof of payment for the $529.10 ($481 + GST).Â 

Therefore, no further payment to the plumbers needs to be made for this, since I have fully paid.Â

Subject: C111/2 Banilung St - quick questions

Â 

Hi Bowen,

Â 

I hope you are well.

Â 

I've made the payment today for the next two weeks rent, so this should show your side in the next few days.

Â 

We just have a few of questions for you:

Â 

- we noticed there is a gas outlet pipe behind the sofa, is it possible for a Carbon monoxide alarm to be installed to ensure there is an alarm in place for safety? I'm happy to buy and install and be reimbursed for the cost of the alarm if that would work? I can see alarms in Bunnings for around $59 (Quell Worry-Free Carbon Monoxide Alarm - Bunnings Australia<https://www.bunnings.com.au/quell-worry-free-carbon-monoxide-alarm_p4211044?store=7313&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwkIGKBhCxARIsAINMioLok9tcBFKqpKXyzGL8gSNTi_lSrV4R1pNWkyJKvTaUQHrr6j4JKaQaApajEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds>), so please let me know if this is okay. Please can you confirm when this outlet was last serviced?

Â 

- the bedroom window is quite dirty and we can't reach to clean it, do you know if this is something that is managed by the Strata for the building? Is it possible to book a cleaning at all?

Â 

- the washing machine is sometimes a bit temperamentalÂ and is sometimes pausing and not starting the cycle, it does work after being reset and we are happy to carry on monitoring it for a bit, but just wanted to flag this

Â 

Please can you also provide the reference to us when the bond is lodged.

Â 

Thank you for your help.

Â 

Best regards,

Alex

Subject: C111/2 Banilung St - quick questions

Hi Bowen,

I hope you are well.

I've made the payment today for the next two weeks rent, so this should show your side in the next few days.

We just have a few of questions for you:

- we noticed there is a gas outlet pipe behind the sofa, is it possible for a Carbon monoxide alarm to be installed to ensure there is an alarm in place for safety? I'm happy to buy and install and be reimbursed for the cost of the alarm if that would work? I can see alarms in Bunnings for around $59 (Quell Worry-Free Carbon Monoxide Alarm - Bunnings Australia<https://www.bunnings.com.au/quell-worry-free-carbon-monoxide-alarm_p4211044?store=7313&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwkIGKBhCxARIsAINMioLok9tcBFKqpKXyzGL8gSNTi_lSrV4R1pNWkyJKvTaUQHrr6j4JKaQaApajEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds>), so please let me know if this is okay. Please can you confirm when this outlet was last serviced?

- the bedroom window is quite dirty and we can't reach to clean it, do you know if this is something that is managed by the Strata for the building? Is it possible to book a cleaning at all?

- the washing machine is sometimes a bit temperamentalÂ and is sometimes pausing and not starting the cycle, it does work after being reset and we are happy to carry on monitoring it for a bit, but just wanted to flag this

Please can you also provide the reference to us when the bond is lodged.

Thank you for your help.

Best regards,

Alex

Just to provide further info on the gas pipe, we noticed it after smelling a faint gas odour whilst sitting on the sofa, so think there may be a slight leak at some times from this pipe, as we noticed the smell only in that corner and not near the gas stove. Would it be therefore be possible for someone to come and check this please?

Iâve attached a picture of the pipe for reference.Â 

Thank you for your help.Â 

Best regards,

AlexÂ

Â Â Â Â WELCOME TO YOUR NEW HOME!

From all us at PIA, we would like to wish you a warm welcome as a new PIA tenant. Below are some important information about your new home. We hope youâll feel at home with us.

IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR TENANCY

*	Property management contact

For any matters regarding your property and tenancy, kindly contact our property management team by sending an email toÂ bowenyuan@pia.com.auÂ and specify your property address in the subject line.Â 

Email would be most direct form of communicationÂ andÂ  ensures a record of all matters for efficient and accurate attention.

*	The condition reportÂ  (To view photos:Â Inspection Report Photos<https://inspection.mypia.com.au/web/conditional-report/public-photo/auth/108523/> Password: ce1b8047)

You have been supplied two copies of the condition report describing condition of the premises. One copy must be returned to your property manager and one for your personal records.Â Please inspect the premise thoroughly (consider taking photographs) and complete and return the reportÂ within 7 days. Â 

*	Rent in advance

Your rent must always be paid two weeksâ in advance, paidÂ threeÂ working days before the due date.

If you are living in a strata premise, please ensure you always respect and comply with the by-laws. The tenancy agreement is included with a copy of standard by-lawsÂ (refer to the tenancy agreement, clause 56).

Should you not receive this copy please contact to your property manager directly.Â 

*	Repairs and Maintenance

When you encounter a maintenance or repair issue to expedite attendance, kindly send an email and accurately describe the issue and perhapsÂ provide a few photosÂ including the unit and surrounding areas.Â If you require assistance due to storm emergencies, please call NSW SES on 132 500.

*	Further information available

If you require further information, please refer to our website,Â http://www.pia.com.au/en/. Where you'll find a wealth of information here on PIA services, PIA investment opportunities, properties for sell and for rent.

Hi Chuhan,

Â 

Thanks for your email. 

Have you tried to clean up the bottom or the out water pipe in the dishwasher? We have many similar case of the dishwashers which is mainly resulted by food blockage. 

We can get a technician to come and fix the problem. However, if they find out the cause is due to food blockage, the tenant will be responsible for the repair cost. 

Would you like to try from your side to avoid potential cost from your side? 

Â

It seems that the dishwasher is not working properly again even though we have tried to reset the program several times. Again, the water was not completely pumped out after the usage. I would appreciate that if you could arrange the maintenance.

Dear Mew,

Â 

Thanks for your prompt reply. We have reset the dishwasher by following the manual. It seems that it works fine for now. Please discard the rectifying request we earlier sent to you.

Â 

ï»¿Hello Mew, 

Â 

Thank you for your information.

Â I would like to ask whether you received the email in relation to our request on the manual of the dishwashing machine early this month?

Â 

Can you kindly provide us with the full electric manual then we can make sure we manipulate it correctly, before you send out your tradesman?Â 

Â 

Without the manual we cannot tell whether the issue is with us or in the machine itself.Â 

Â 

Thank you

Â 

Regards

GraceÂ

Hi Chuhan Wu; Qian Sun,

Hope allâs well.

For your update, we have submitted your maintenance request to the landlord with quotations for seeking their consideration and approval.

For your information, once the tradesman attends only to find misuse/damage rather than a fault with the unit/s, youâll be liable for any associated charges.

Thank you for your continuous patience.

Kind regards,

Dear Max,

Thank you for your time on the phone.

As discussed, we would like to sign a conditional contract pending a satisfactory strata inspection report. We have started this process with our solicitor who advised it would typically take 2-4 days but the lockdown restrictions might impact that.

If the owners agree to this as they have agreed to the offer on these conditions, we would like to start that process through our solicitor straight away.

Thank you for time yesterday.

We have noticed water damage in the kitchen around the washing machine and chipboard. Do you know if it has been an ongoing problem, as the rust on the washing machine would indicate that it has been a problem for a while?

We are very interested but the water damage is a real concern.

Do you also know what is causing the strange stalactites on the terrace?

It is nice to talk with you this morning.

And regarding your question, if you can sign the contract with 0.25% deposit, we will take the property off the market.

There are 5 days cooling offÂ period in NSW standard, and if you would like to request more days on that, you'd better get a conveyancer to request it in formal and put the condition in the contract.

LetÂ me know if you have any questions, I am happy to help.

Hi Max and Judy,

Thank you for time yesterday.

We have noticed water damage in the kitchen around the washing machine and chipboard. Do you know if it has been an ongoing problem, as the rust on the washing machine would indicate that it has been a problem for a while?

We are very interested but the water damage is a real concern.

Do you also know what is causing the strange stalactites on the terrace?

Thank you for your email.

For the following issue, please find the comments.

1) We are finalising the rent as 470 per week and one week rent free. - confirmed.

2) As we haven't seen the secure parking and storage cage during the inspection so you will send us the photograph of secure car parking space and storage in the basement tomorrow. -Storage photo attached, car parking is at the lowest basement.

3) For the master bedroom the window doesn't open properly and we can't have proper ventilation within the room and house. Please check the possibility of making it properly open at least.- once you collected the keys, tried the window keys.

4) Please do confirm about the washing machine outlets as I couldn't see any during my inspection. -photo attached.

5) Also put the name of my wife on the rent agreement and I am attaching her NSW photo ID for reference. - Judy will do.

6) Also, as discussed and confirmed by you that house was properly cleaned few weeks before and no further cleaning is required. Please do share the evidence for the same. Moreover, as agreed we also don't need to do get the professional cleaning while moving out from this unit at the end of lease agreement. -partial agree, The condition and cleaning is quite good, we hope you can return the property as similar as when you move in. Therefore, we do recommend you to use our cleaner to do the end of lease cleaning to avoid any argument, which is easier for you, for us and also for the next tenant.

7) As agreed you can get the lease signed at Wentworthville itself. - Judy follow up.

8) I have made the payment of one week and I have attached the receipt below for your reference. I will start the lease from 1st Feb 2020. -confirmed.

Hi Judy,

Thanks for your email. I tried to call you but it looks like you are busy. As discussed over the rent part, I was putting 450$ per week in my application but increased it already to 460$ as you told it will be approved by the Landlord. And landlord is seeking better tenants not looking for higher rent. But now it's not the case. Request you to please look into and try to settle the rent to 460$ per week. 

Please feel free to call me to discuss further.

Hello Effie & Judy,

Unit 25/300-308 Great Western Highway, Wentworthville, NSW

Please refer below email of my cargo agent received yesterday only, due to unexpected and unforeseen circumstances at Singapore Port my cargo container from Mumbai to Sydney gotÂ delayed and is now reaching at Sydney on 26th Jan with at least one week of quarantine. This means that I will not receive my cargo or goods at the Unit by 3rd Feb.

As the above circumstances were only known to me yesterday from the cargo agent, may I please request your office and the Owner to delay commencement of the rent agreement from 21st Jan by 2 weeks i.e. to start the rent contract from 3rd Feb. If this is possible, I will be reallyÂ gratefulÂ to you as well as the Owner for understanding and support. Without the cargo it will be not possible to stay in the Unit as my cargo contains fridge, washing machine, entire kitchen appliances, beds and mattresses and full furniture.

Upon your confirmation only I will the proceed to change my air tickets, as it will involve further change costs and higher difference of price too.

Please revert at the earliest so that I may do other needful too.

Regards,

Manish Madhok

Hello Raina,

Please cancel my request for delay in commencement of rent agreement. I will try to get home furniture on rent and will work out rest of things as planned.

Please do not change the date of start of rent contract, I will meet you guys on 21st Jan at your office to sign the lease.

Hi Manish,

Thank you for your email.

This is Raina, the property manager of Unit 45.

I fully understand your situation.

However, the move in date, 21/01/2010 is one of the reasons that your application has been approved.

It would be difficult to change the lease start date from the landlordâs end as two weeks vacancy occur.

I will try to convince the landlord to commence the lease on 28/01/2020, which means both parties make one week concession on this matter.

Your understanding is appreciated.

Hi Rayne

This email is just to say thanks to you and of course our owner for arranging the brackets and getting it installed. 

I've also got some letters in my mailbox for her which seem to be from bank. I can handover those as soon as I meet Judy. 

Thank you for your cooperation. 

Cheers

Just to keep you posted, please see the below reply from landlord just now and if anything I will keep you posted again:

I have contacted the spare part team of the manufacturer yesterday. It will take 24-48 hours to get the reply. Anyway, if I donât get the reply by tomorrow, I will place the order and mail directly to the tenant. The cost will be on me even if it does not fit. I will reply to youÂ tomorrow afternoon.

Hi Rayne

I don't mind following up with them but they have to put the brackets (which should be owner and your concern) as it will surely damage my washing machine if it is kept for longer time. 

He told me that we informed owner that we would bring the brackets in a few days and fix it. 

How long are they going to take and when are they going to do this is owners responsibility (not mine) but yes if I am living in an apartment and I don't have any personal issues to follow up with the tradesman it doesn't justify that owner or you should not take responsibility of what is not being completed. 

I hope it makes sense now.

Hi Rayne

Yes, I called him and he said they would get back to me once the brackets are available but why do I have to follow up with him? I don't understand this. Do you think is it my fault to keep it over there?

Hoping you in a sound health. I tried to contact the service people but no luck about the updates on the brackets.

Appreciate if you can follow up with them as well.

Hi Rayne

I don't mind following up with them but they have to put the brackets (which should be owner and your concern) as it will surely damage my washing machine if it is kept for longer time. 

He told me that we informed owner that we would bring the brackets in a few days and fix it. 

How long are they going to take and when are they going to do this is owners responsibility (not mine) but yes if I am living in an apartment and I don't have any personal issues to follow up with the tradesman it doesn't justify that owner or you should not take responsibility of what is not being completed. 

I hope it makes sense now. 

All is good at my end as long as you or owner ensure that it is going to be fixed soon.

He told me the same thing that he told you, then I have updated the landlord and the landlord have no issue with it as long as the problem fixed.

But now you have your concern (which is not agent or the landlord concern). 

Hence I suggest you to communicate with him as this will be more efficient and you will understand well.

No worries. I'll shift from 20th only. Will collect the keys on 18th.

Hi Ankur

As your move in date is Sunday 20th Oct, but we give you keys on 18th which is Friday, if you want to move in on 14th, your move in date will start from 14th, your rental payment will start from 14th as well. 

Please advise if youâd like to push the move in date forward. We are not allowed to give keys early.

Cheers

Hi Effie

This is in regard to my unit 28, 300-308, Great Western Highway, Wentworthville<https://www.google.com/maps/search/unit+28,+300-308,+Great+Western+Highway,+Wentworthville?entry=gmail&amp;source=g>. 

Actually I have a slight situation here. I happened to purchase a few appliances(used) from an acquaintanceÂ and they would need to delivered to me latest by 14 October.Â I am scheduled to sign the contract on the 18th of October and move in from the 20th. 

Is there a possibility that the unit be opened for keeping just two major appliances viz the washing machine and the refrigerator before the lease period commences. I donot wish to keep the keys in my possession but if you could please allow us to keep just these two items it would be a greatly appreciated help.

Note: I am working out with them as well if there is a possibility to delay the delivery. Will let you know on the exact time in a separate email.

Thanking you in Anticipation

Hi Rayne

I don't mind following up with them but they have to put the brackets (which should be owner and your concern) as it will surely damage my washing machine if it is kept for longer time. 

He told me that we informed owner that we would bring the brackets in a few days and fix it. 

How long are they going to take and when are they going to do this is owners responsibility (not mine) but yes if I am living in an apartment and I don't have any personal issues to follow up with the tradesman it doesn't justify that owner or you should not take responsibility of what is not being completed. 

I hope it makes sense now. 

All is good at my end as long as you or owner ensure that it is going to be fixed soon.

He told me the same thing that he told you, then I have updated the landlord and the landlord have no issue with it as long as the problem fixed.

But now you have your concern (which is not agent or the landlord concern). 

Hence I suggest you to communicate with him as this will be more efficient and you will understand well.

Hi Arafat,

He told me the same thing that he told you, then I have updated the landlord and the landlord have no issue with it as long as the problem fixed.

But now you have your concern (which is not agent or the landlord concern). 

Hence I suggest you to communicate with him as this will be more efficient and you will understand well.

Thank you.

Hi Rayne

Yes, I called him and he said they would get back to me once the brackets are available but why do I have to follow up with him? I don't understand this. Do you think is it my fault to keep it over there?

Hi Rayne

Please see the attached photo and please request owner to arrange something as soon as possible. If my washing machine gets affected then who will be responsible for the damage?

Looking forward to your urgent response.

Hi Rayne

I don't mind following up with them but they have to put the brackets (which should be owner and your concern) as it will surely damage my washing machine if it is kept for longer time. 

He told me that we informed owner that we would bring the brackets in a few days and fix it. 

How long are they going to take and when are they going to do this is owners responsibility (not mine) but yes if I am living in an apartment and I don't have any personal issues to follow up with the tradesman it doesn't justify that owner or you should not take responsibility of what is not being completed. 

I hope it makes sense now.

Hi Judy,

Hope you are doing good.

Unfortunately, my current project has got obstacle as mentioned in the below email and I have been asked to prepare to leave the country by the 20th of September.

It is really unfortunate as I have sold all my stuff while leaving India and bought Bed+Mattress, Refrigerator and Washing Machine thinking I would get settled in Australia.

My employer is trying to find me another opportunity to stay back in Sydney. 

The worse situation would be I have to leave the country by 20th of September if another opportunity would not work for me.

Kindly, please help to advise me the procedure I need to follow to vacate the place with good relationship with PIA.

I would really appreciate all of your help in this situation for me and my family.

Hope you will understand with a big heart and help me in my current scenario.

Thank you.

It's unfortunate but you may have to wind up the assignment earlier based on clients feedback. As discussed pls plan for return offshore in next 4 weeks if no opportunity works out in Sydney.

Hi Judy,

Hope you are doing good.

Unfortunately, my current project has got obstacle as mentioned in the below email and I have been asked to prepare to leave the country by the 20th of September.

It is really unfortunate as I have sold all my stuff while leaving India and bought Bed+Mattress, Refrigerator and Washing Machine thinking I would get settled in Australia.

My employer is trying to find me another opportunity to stay back in Sydney. 

The worse situation would be I have to leave the country by 20th of September if another opportunity would not work for me.

Kindly, please help to advise me the procedure I need to follow to vacate the place with good relationship with PIA.

I would really appreciate all of your help in this situation for me and my family.

Hope you will understand with a big heart and help me in my current scenario.

Thank you.

It's unfortunate but you may have to wind up the assignment earlier based on clients feedback. As discussed pls plan for return offshore in next 4 weeks if no opportunity works out in Sydney.

Hi Judy 

Thank you for taking out time today. As you know that our deal is now finalized. I have a few things for you to consider;

1.	A thorough cleaning is required as I shown you from the entrance and esp. the corners of the room and esp. in the balconies
2.	The antenna (dish) needs to be removed from balcony
3.	You will also provide me the fully functional dishwasher as the cap was missing.
4.	If you think we can buy the refrigerator and washing machine from the owner then please let me know and I will be happy to talk about it.

Secondly, if you can also share the pictures of old setup how things were organized in rooms (just for our reference, that'd be great).Â 

You also mentioned about EFTPOS transaction. Can I transfer the 500 right now through BPAY and do the whole payment from EFTPOS during the contract is done? Is it fine?Â 

Please let me know.Â 

Thanks

Arafat

Dear Arafat Tehsin,

Many thanks for your submitted application. I am pleased to advise you that your application for the above mentioned property has been successful and the landlord would like to offer the property to you for rent.

We would like to confirm the following:

*	Rent:Â $530.00 per week
*	Lease Term:Â 12 months
*	Commencement date:Â 23/08/2019

Should you agree to the above terms and are willing to accept, we require a holding fee of 1 week's rent to keep the property off the market for you until the lease commencement (or longer by agreement). The said holding fee is to be paid via BPay to the following details below:

*	BPay Biller Code:Â 4481
*	DEFT Reference No:Â 0037379351

This can be done via theÂ BPayÂ function through your internet banking provider, by going toÂ www.deft.com.au<http://www.deft.com.au/>Â or callingÂ 1300 301 090Â with the above code and reference. Should you wish to pay the deposit in person at our office we do acceptÂ EFTPOSÂ with no fee. Any other means of payment shall incur a 1.5% surcharge for bank fees.

In accordance to the Residential Tenancies Act 2010, and in consideration to the holding fee paid by you, we acknowledge that:

5.	If a residential tenancy agreement is entered into, the holding fee is to be paid towards rent for the residential premises concerned.
6.	The whole of the fee will be refunded to the prospective tenant if: 
*	the entering into of the residential tenancy agreement is conditional on the landlord carrying out repairs or other work and the landlord does not carry out the repairs or other work during the specified period;
*	the landlord/landlordâs agent have failed to disclose a material fact(s) or made misrepresentation(s) before entering into the residential tenancy agreement.

Hello Judyï¼

I will arrange the cleaning tomorrow. 

As for the antenna, I have no idea where to dispose it. I need your help to arrange the disposal and of course at my cost. The dish washer was changed installed two weeks ago and should be fully functioning. I am aware the cover board is missing, but it does not affect its working at all. You can tell the tenant about that. Thank you.

Hello Judyï¼

I will arrange the cleaning tomorrow. 

As for the antenna, I have no idea where to dispose it. I need your help to arrange the disposal and of course at my cost. The dish washer was changed installed two weeks ago and should be fully functioning. I am aware the cover board is missing, but it does not affect its working at all. You can tell the tenant about that. Thank you.

Regards,

Sarena Jin

Hi Judy

Thank you for taking out time today. As you know that our deal is now finalized. I have a few things for you to consider;

1.	A thorough cleaning is required as I shown you from the entrance and esp. the corners of the room and esp. in the balconies
2.	The antenna (dish) needs to be removed from balcony
3.	You will also provide me the fully functional dishwasher as the cap was missing.
4.	If you think we can buy the refrigerator and washing machine from the owner then please let me know and I will be happy to talk about it.

Secondly, if you can also share the pictures of old setup how things were organized in rooms (just for our reference, that'd be great). 

You also mentioned about EFTPOS transaction. Can I transfer the 500 right now through BPAY and do the whole payment from EFTPOS during the contract is done? Is it fine? 

Please let me know. 

Thanks

Arafat

Thank you for taking out time today. As you know that our deal is now finalized. I have a few things for you to consider;

1.	A thorough cleaning is required as I shown you from the entrance and esp. the corners of the room and esp. in the balconies
2.	The antenna (dish) needs to be removed from balcony
3.	You will also provide me the fully functional dishwasher as the cap was missing.
4.	If you think we can buy the refrigerator and washing machine from the owner then please let me know and I will be happy to talk about it.

Secondly, if you can also share the pictures of old setup how things were organized in rooms (just for our reference, that'd be great). 

You also mentioned about EFTPOS transaction. Can I transfer the 500 right now through BPAY and do the whole payment from EFTPOS during the contract is done? Is it fine? 

Please let me know. 

Thanks

Arafat

Hi Judy 

Thanks for theÂ email. Looks promising. Once we meet tomorrow morning around 10:30 ~ 11 -- I will be able to transfer the funds right away at that time if that's OK for you. The reason for this as I would like to show you a few things in the apartment which I found during my inspection as you were not present. 

Having said that, I have accepted and we will hopefully be going with the same apartment.

Looking forward to meet you tomorrow.

Dear Arafat Tehsin,

Many thanks for your submitted application. I am pleased to advise you that your application for the above mentioned property has been successful and the landlord would like to offer the property to you for rent.

We would like to confirm the following:

*	Rent:Â $530.00 per week

*	BPay Biller Code:Â 4481

Hi Judy,

Thanks for your time over theÂ phone. I would like to highlight the points we agreed on accepting to lease the property at Unit 30, 19-25 Garfield street , Wentworthville NSW 2145<https://www.google.com/maps/search/Unit+30,+19-25+Garfield+street+,+Wentworthville+NSW+2145?entry=gmail&amp;source=g>.

1) We areÂ finalising the rent as 470 per week and one week rent free.

2) As we haven't seen the secure parking and storage cage during the inspection so you will send us theÂ photograph of secure car parking space and storage in the basement tomorrow.

3) For the master bedroom the window doesn't openÂ properly and we can't have proper ventilation within the room and house. Please checkÂ theÂ possibility of making it properly open at least.

4) Please do confirm about the washing machine outlets as IÂ couldn't see any during my inspection. 

5) Also put the name of my wife on the rent agreement and I am attaching her NSW photo ID for reference.

6) Also, as discussed and confirmed by you that house was properly cleaned few weeks before and no further cleaning is required. Please do share the evidence for the same. Moreover, as agreed we also don't need to do get the professional cleaning while moving out from this unit at the end of lease agreement.

7) As agreed you can get the leaseÂ signed at Wentworthville itself.

8) I have made the payment of oneÂ week and I have attached theÂ receipt below for your reference. I will start the lease from 1st Feb 2020.

Hi Judy,

Thanks for your email. I tried to call you but it looks like you are busy. As discussed over the rent part, I was putting 450$ per week in my application but increased it already to 460$ as you told it will be approved by the Landlord. And landlord is seeking better tenants not looking for higher rent. But now it's not the case. Request you to please look into and try to settle the rent to 460$ per week. 

Please feel free to call me to discuss further.

Hello Raina,

Please cancel my request for delay in commencement of rent agreement. I will try to get home furniture on rent and will work out rest of things as planned.

Please do not change the date of start of rent contract, I will meet you guys on 21st Jan at your office to sign the lease.

Hi Manish,

Thank you for your email.

This is Raina, the property manager of Unit 45.

I fully understand your situation.

However, the move in date, 21/01/2010 is one of the reasons that your application has been approved.

It would be difficult to change the lease start date from the landlordâs end as two weeks vacancy occur.

I will try to convince the landlord to commence the lease on 28/01/2020, which means both parties make one week concession on this matter.

Your understanding is appreciated.

Regard,

Raina Yao

Hello Effie & Judy,

Unit 25/300-308 Great Western Highway, Wentworthville, NSW<https://www.google.com/maps/search/Unit+25%2F300-308+Great+Western+Highway,+Wentworthville,+NSW?entry=gmail&amp;source=g>

Please refer below email of my cargo agent received yesterday only, due to unexpected and unforeseen circumstances at Singapore Port my cargo container from Mumbai to Sydney gotÂ delayed and is now reaching at Sydney on 26th Jan with at least one week of quarantine. This means that I will not receive my cargo or goods at the Unit by 3rd Feb.

As the above circumstances were only known to me yesterday from the cargo agent, may I please request your office and the Owner to delay commencement of the rent agreement from 21st Jan by 2 weeks i.e. to start the rent contract from 3rd Feb. If this is possible, I will be reallyÂ gratefulÂ to you as well as the Owner for understanding and support. Without the cargo it will be not possible to stay in the Unit as my cargo contains fridge, washing machine, entire kitchen appliances, beds and mattresses and full furniture.

Upon your confirmation only I will the proceed to change my air tickets, as it will involve further change costs and higher difference of price too.

Please revert at the earliest so that I may do other needful too.

Is there a possibility that the unit be opened for keeping just two major appliances viz the washing machine and the refrigerator before the lease period commences. I donot wish to keep the keys in my possession but if you could please allow us to keep just these two items it would be a greatly appreciated help.

Note: I am working out with them as well if there is a possibility to delay the delivery. Will let you know on the exact time in a separate email.

I don't mind following up with them but they have to put the brackets (which should be owner and your concern) as it will surely damage my washing machine if it is kept for longer time. 

He told me that we informed owner that we would bring the brackets in a few days and fix it. 

How long are they going to take and when are they going to do this is owners responsibility (not mine) but yes if I am living in an apartment and I don't have any personal issues to follow up with the tradesman it doesn't justify that owner or you should not take responsibility of what is not being completed. 

I hope it makes sense now.

Hi Rayne

Yes, I called him and he said they would get back to me once the brackets are available but why do I have to follow up with him? I don't understand this. Do you think is it my fault to keep it over there?

Hi Rayne

Please see the attached photo and please request owner to arrange something as soon as possible. If my washing machine gets affected then who will be responsible for the damage?

Looking forward to your urgent response.

Hi Judy,

Hope you are doing good.

Unfortunately, my current project has got obstacle as mentioned in the below email and I have been asked to prepare to leave the country by the 20th of September.

It is really unfortunate as I have sold all my stuff while leaving India and bought Bed+Mattress, Refrigerator and Washing Machine thinking I would get settled in Australia.

My employer is trying to find me another opportunity to stay back in Sydney. 

The worse situation would be I have to leave the country by 20th of September if another opportunity would not work for me.

Kindly, please help to advise me the procedure I need to follow to vacate the place with good relationship with PIA.

I would really appreciate all of your help in this situation for me and my family.

Hope you will understand with a big heart and help me in my current scenario.

Thank you.

It's unfortunate but you may have to wind up the assignment earlier based on clients feedback. As discussed pls plan for return offshore in next 4 weeks if no opportunity works out in Sydney.

Hi Judy 

Thank you for taking out time today. As you know that our deal is now finalized. I have a few things for you to consider;

1.	A thorough cleaning is required as I shown you from the entrance and esp. the corners of the room and esp. in the balconies
2.	The antenna (dish) needs to be removed from balcony
3.	You will also provide me the fully functional dishwasher as the cap was missing.
4.	If you think we can buy the refrigerator and washing machine from the owner then please let me know and I will be happy to talk about it.

Secondly, if you can also share the pictures of old setup how things were organized in rooms (just for our reference, that'd be great). 

You also mentioned about EFTPOS transaction. Can I transfer the 500 right now through BPAY and do the whole payment from EFTPOS during the contract is done? Is it fine? 

Please let me know. 

Thanks

Arafat

Dear Arafat Tehsin,

Many thanks for your submitted application. I am pleased to advise you that your application for the above mentioned property has been successful and the landlord would like to offer the property to you for rent.

We would like to confirm the following:

*	Rent:Â $530.00 per week
*	Lease Term:Â 12 months
*	Commencement date:Â 23/08/2019

Should you agree to the above terms and are willing to accept, we require a holding fee of 1 week's rent to keep the property off the market for you until the lease commencement (or longer by agreement). The said holding fee is to be paid via BPay to the following details below:

*	BPay Biller Code:Â 4481
*	DEFT Reference No:Â 0037379351

This can be done via the BPayÂ function through your internet banking provider, by going to www.deft.com.au<http://www.deft.com.au/>Â or calling 1300 301 090Â with the above code and reference. Should you wish to pay the deposit in person at our office we do accept EFTPOSÂ with no fee. Any other means of payment shall incur a 1.5% surcharge for bank fees.

In accordance to the Residential Tenancies Act 2010, and in consideration to the holding fee paid by you, we acknowledge that:

1.	The application for tenancy has been approved by the landlord; and
2.	The premises will not be let during that above period, pending the making of a residential tenancy agreement; and
3.	The applicant have inspected the property and accept the property condition
4.	if the prospective tenant(s) decide not to enter into such an agreement, the landlord may retain the whole fee; and
5.	If a residential tenancy agreement is entered into, the holding fee is to be paid towards rent for the residential premises concerned.
6.	The whole of the fee will be refunded to the prospective tenant if: 
*	the entering into of the residential tenancy agreement is conditional on the landlord carrying out repairs or other work and the landlord does not carry out the repairs or other work during the specified period;
*	the landlord/landlordâs agent have failed to disclose a material fact(s) or made misrepresentation(s) before entering into the residential tenancy agreement.

Kindly scan/email or fax the BPay transfer confirmation (receipt) to our leasing manager at judyzhu@pia.com.au<mailto:judyzhu@pia.com.au>Â or fax (02)8221 9865 ASAP. The agent reserve the right to approve another application before deposit taken of the relevant premise.

Should you decide not to accept and decline, please reply to us via email or phone ASAP by close of business today. There may be other applicants that the landlord is considering and they are also waiting reply of acceptance from us. Should we not receive any reply or receipt of payment, we shall release the property to another applicant.

Best regards,

Hello Judyï¼

I will arrange the cleaning tomorrow. 

As for the antenna, I have no idea where to dispose it. I need your help to arrange the disposal and of course at my cost. The dish washer was changed installed two weeks ago and should be fully functioning. I am aware the cover board is missing, but it does not affect its working at all. You can tell the tenant about that. Thank you.

Hello Judyï¼

I will arrange the cleaning tomorrow. 

As for the antenna, I have no idea where to dispose it. I need your help to arrange the disposal and of course at my cost. The dish washer was changed installed two weeks ago and should be fully functioning. I am aware the cover board is missing, but it does not affect its working at all. You can tell the tenant about that. Thank you.

Regards,

Sarena Jin

Hi Judy

Thank you for taking out time today. As you know that our deal is now finalized. I have a few things for you to consider;

1.	A thorough cleaning is required as I shown you from the entrance and esp. the corners of the room and esp. in the balconies
2.	The antenna (dish) needs to be removed from balcony
3.	You will also provide me the fully functional dishwasher as the cap was missing.
4.	If you think we can buy the refrigerator and washing machine from the owner then please let me know and I will be happy to talk about it.

Secondly, if you can also share the pictures of old setup how things were organized in rooms (just for our reference, that'd be great). 

You also mentioned about EFTPOS transaction. Can I transfer the 500 right now through BPAY and do the whole payment from EFTPOS during the contract is done? Is it fine? 

Please let me know. 

Thanks

Arafat

Hi Judy

Thank you for taking out time today. As you know that our deal is now finalized. I have a few things for you to consider;

1.	A thorough cleaning is required as I shown you from the entrance and esp. the corners of the room and esp. in the balconies
2.	The antenna (dish) needs to be removed from balcony
3.	You will also provide me the fully functional dishwasher as the cap was missing.
4.	If you think we can buy the refrigerator and washing machine from the owner then please let me know and I will be happy to talk about it.

Secondly, if you can also share the pictures of old setup how things were organized in rooms (just for our reference, that'd be great). 

You also mentioned about EFTPOS transaction. Can I transfer the 500 right now through BPAY and do the whole payment from EFTPOS during the contract is done? Is it fine? 

Please let me know. 

Thanks

Arafat

Hi Judy 

Thanks for theÂ email. Looks promising. Once we meet tomorrow morning around 10:30 ~ 11 -- I will be able to transfer the funds right away at that time if that's OK for you. The reason for this as I would like to show you a few things in the apartment which I found during my inspection as you were not present. 

Having said that, I have accepted and we will hopefully be going with the same apartment.

Looking forward to meet you tomorrow.

Hi Max and Judy,

Â 

Thank you for time yesterday.

Â 

We have noticed water damage in the kitchen around the washing machine and chipboard. Do you know if it has been an ongoing problem, as the rust on the washing machine would indicate that it has been a problem for a while?

Â 

We are very interested but the water damage is a real concern.

Â 

Do you also know what is causing the strange stalactites on the terrace?Â <cid:image001.jpg@01D777FD.F53D1050><cid:image002.jpg@01D777FD.F53D1050>

Hi Muskaan Nagdev & Tejaswini Chepyala & Ambresh Bajaj & Shruti,

Thanks for your email.Â 

The landlord might choose not to repair the washing machine as it not worth to repair.Â 

Therefore, I will convince her to give $200.00 rent credit to remove the machine and you could get the new washing machine from your own and when you leave the property, you could take it with you.Â 

Please kindly let me know it this option more suitable for you?

HiÂ Ivy,Â 

Â 

The plumber looked at the leaking water under washing machine, and told us that itâs not a plumbing issue, the washing machine is leaking.Â 

And now the washing machine has completely stopped working.Â 

Â 

Can you arrange someone to repair the washing machine?Â 

Â 

And if it could be fixed as soon as possible,Â that would be great.Â

If the tenant already brought the new washing machine, you could ask for reimbursement as landlord prefer to have a washing machine inside the apartment. 

If you ever have any further enquires. Please do not hesitate to reply me directly via this email.

Have a nice day.

Kind Regards,

Unit 1008/208 Coward St, MASCOT - wishing machine is not working

Hi Feng,

Hope you are well. 

The tenant ofÂ Unit 1008/208 Coward St, MASCOT reported to us that the washing machine is stop working. It is not worth to repair and better leave it as not washing machine for next tenant to avoidÂ further maintenance 

Therefore, I will advise to give $200.00 rent credit to remove the machine and tenant could get the new washing machine from their own and when they leave the property, they could take it with them. 

Please kindly let me know is this option more suitable for you then replace the new washing machineÂ for them?

Kind Regards,

HiÂ Ivy, 

The plumber looked at the leaking water under washing machine, and told us that itâs not a plumbing issue, the washing machine is leaking. 

And now the washing machine has completely stopped working. 

Can you arrange someone to repair the washing machine? 

And if it could be fixed as soon as possible,Â that would be great.

Hi Leon,

The common washing machine for our unit has not been working since last 2 days, I was told by the neighbour that he will notify, but I'm not sure if has done so. It would be a great help if you can send a technician to have a look at it.

Thanks

Thanks

Thanks for your reply.

However in my experience, it takes 2-3 months to get this up and running from date of application to actual date of the internet connection and we cannot afford that down time once we move in.

Really appreciate your kind assistance however we needto find a more suited rental property that will no longer require us to put effort on the paperwork and process of getting the internet connection.

This is the portal I used to do this in my old rental property: https://www.nbnco.com.au/develop-or-plan-with-the-nbn/new-developments/submit-and-apply. You may want to suggest to the owner to prepare this first on their side and get it done.

If you can give me other rental property options in Eastwood, Carlingford, West Epping, Ermington area and within the $350 to $450 per week range, we are keen to check as well.

My main criteria are:

1. Relatively new property

2. Good school (high ranking) catchment area

3. 2BR

4. 1 CARPARK

5. NBN-ready, dishwasher, air-conditioner, built-in washing machine (optional)

Really appreciate your time on responding to these queries.

Thanks & Regards,

Hi Jaydee,

I rerently received the $300 NBN new management fee invoice from my tenant in same building . Maybe you can try to call NBN company if they can set up NBN for you. Landlord will pay the $300 first set up cost. If not even you have to use the opticom if there is the first set up cost the landlord will pay as well. 

Hope this information helps .

Thanks, Elaine.

I understand Opticomm is an alternative to NBN and that is what this building has.

Just wanted to clarify, there is no more need for the tenant to arrange with Opticomm to install the hardware needed to connect to the internet. There is already a hardware and it is a matter of choosing a provider on the tenant's side?

Or maybe an easier way to figure this out, was the previous tenant of this unit able to connect to the internet using Opticomm?

Just wanted to make sure of this because in my previous rental property, I had to be the one to arrange w/ NBN the installation of hardware on behalf of the owner and paid $300 for this. 

Hope you can confirm on this prior to our application as we are keen onÂ moving ahead with the application.

Thanks & Regards,

Ideally we'd like to do the walkthrough at the apartment on Wednesday the 24th. We're happy to sign the lease and get the keys at the apartment after completing a walkthrough. If we need to be at the office for formality then we're happy to drive down to the office after checking out the apartment one last time. 

Additionally, are you able to get us the refrigeratorÂ measurements that this apartment can accommodate? We need this by Saturday to lock in our appliances for the new place. If you're unable to get these measurements, can you please advise who can?

Many thanks,

Hi Thi,

The bond has been received, I have noticed from Fair Trading.

Please beware, you need to pay 2 weeks' rent advance (you paid one week as a holding deposit) so there is anotherÂ $450 to pay to the biller code :4481 with your reference number. This payment needs to send me back the receipt like the holding deposit. This payment needs to be done by Friday then I can prepare the contract for next week.

I will invite you to come to the office on 24th March 11:30am to sign the lease and take the keys.

Apologies for the double email. 

Just wanted to list a few questions we have to help ease the upcoming move. 

1. Internet connection - Do you know what type of internet connections are available in this building? I'm having trouble finding a provider. 

2. Washing Machine & Dryer - Are there any size restrictions in regard to the Washing Machine that can be installed in this unit? Also, I may have missed this during the inspection, is a dryer already installed?

3. During the move, is there any restricted access to the unit? Is there a specific lift to use when moving furniture or is the common lift okay to use?

4. Are moving vans/trucks allowed to be parked in front of the unit to unload?

Thanks in advance!

Many thanks,

Thi

Hello Elaine,

Thanks for your reply.

However in my experience, it takes 2-3 months to get this up and running from date of application to actual date of the internet connection and we cannot afford that down time once we move in.

Really appreciate your kind assistance however we needto find a more suited rental property that will no longer require us to put effort on the paperwork and process of getting the internet connection.

This is the portal I used to do this in my old rental property: https://www.nbnco.com.au/develop-or-plan-with-the-nbn/new-developments/submit-and-apply. You may want to suggest to the owner to prepare this first on their side and get it done.

If you can give me other rental property options in Eastwood, Carlingford, West Epping, Ermington area and within the $350 to $450 per week range, we are keen to check as well.

My main criteria are:

1. Relatively new property

2. Good school (high ranking) catchment area

Hi Jaydee,

I rerently received the $300 NBN new management fee invoice from my tenant in same building . Maybe you can try to call NBN company if they can set up NBN for you. Landlord will pay the $300 first set up cost. If not even you have to use the opticom if there is the first set up cost the landlord will pay as well. 

Hope this information helps .

Thanks, Elaine.

I understand Opticomm is an alternative to NBN and that is what this building has.

Just wanted to clarify, there is no more need for the tenant to arrange with Opticomm to install the hardware needed to connect to the internet. There is already a hardware and it is a matter of choosing a provider on the tenant's side?

Or maybe an easier way to figure this out, was the previous tenant of this unit able to connect to the internet using Opticomm?

Just wanted to make sure of this because in my previous rental property, I had to be the one to arrange w/ NBN the installation of hardware on behalf of the owner and paid $300 for this. 

Hope you can confirm on this prior to our application as we are keen onÂ moving ahead with the application.

Thanks & Regards,

Jaydee

Hello Elaine,

Thanks for accommodating on yesterday's inspection on the above property.

Just wanted to confirm from your side that the unit is NBN-ready as this is critical for my WFH setup and my wife's university study.

I already sent an inquiry to my provider, however I noticed on the search sites the below results which doesn't seem to indicate that the property is on their database:

The bond has been received, I have noticed from Fair Trading.

Please beware, you need to pay 2 weeks' rent advance (you paid one week as a holding deposit) so there is anotherÂ $450 to pay to the biller code :4481 with your reference number. This payment needs to send me back the receipt like the holding deposit. This payment needs to be done by Friday then I can prepare the contract for next week.

I will invite you to come to the office on 24th March 11:30am to sign the lease and take the keys.

Hi Elaine,

Apologies for the double email. 

Just wanted to list a few questions we have to help ease the upcoming move. 

1. Internet connection - Do you know what type of internet connections are available in this building? I'm having trouble finding a provider. 

2. Washing Machine & Dryer - Are there any size restrictions in regard to the Washing Machine that can be installed in this unit? Also, I may have missed this during the inspection, is a dryer already installed?

3. During the move, is there any restricted access to the unit? Is there a specific lift to use when moving furniture or is the common lift okay to use?

4. Are moving vans/trucks allowed to be parked in front of the unit to unload?

Thanks in advance!

Hi Peter,Â 

Â 

Thank you for sending through the supporting documents.Â 

Â 

The agreed upon lease terms are as follows:

1. Lease Commencement Date: 12/02/2021

2. Lease Term: 12 monthsÂ 

3. Weekly Rent: $480.00

4. Approval for Murphy the Boston TerrierÂ 

Â 

To pay your holding deposit and second week rent in advance, a Bpay code will be generated and sent to you via SMS to pay your holding deposit. Closer to your move in date, we will require an additional week of rent which together with your holding deposit will contribute to

your first two weeks' rental payments.Â 

Â 

To pay your bond, a bond payment link will also be generated for you and sent to your email. The bond will equate to 4 weeks' rent ($1,920.00)

Â 

Iâve scheduled your outgoing inspection to be conducted 4 PM Tuesday 30/04/2019. We prefer both parties are on site to finalise the condition and bond.

Â 

We suggest to tenant extend the utilities service such as electricity and gas for 2 days in order to have all relevant item can be checkout on the outgoing inspection, or for the tradesman to rectify the item if any outstanding condition required to be rectified. Please note, your bond release can be delayed if the items are not rectified upon outgoing inspection.

Â 

In the meantime, we will carry out the open inspection to obtain the new tenant, we will inform you for the open inspection time beforehand. Generally, open inspections will take up only 15 minutes of your time on a weekday afternoon and Saturday morning. My colleagues and Iâll ensure all attendees are carefully monitored and cause minimal disturbance to you and your property.

Â 

Your landlord would like to thank you in advance for the cooperation.

Â 

Just finally, please provide a brief reason why your vacating, if youâre considering alternate rental accommodation throughout the greater Sydney, please referÂ https://www.pia.com.au/en/rent-property/Â for a list of our currently available properties.

Hi Ivy,

May I please follow up on the washing machine pipe issue I had spoken to you about last week?

Itâs urgent could you please send someone to fix it ?

As mentioned earlier we tried to replace the hose and bought a pipe sealant to prevent dripping too. The issue is with the pipe head, itâs leaking despite trying many ways to fix this issue by ourselves.

We have a huge load of clothes lying around to be washed itâs gettunt very inconvenient. Please send someone to look into this ASAP.

Secondly, the stove top exhaust isnât working, there is some wiring issue, we tried replacing the bulbs as well but itâs not working. 

The dishwasher was replaced on Friday, thank you for getting that done.

Kind Regards 

Shwetha

Hi Ivy

Please find the attached Tenancy condition report.

I have also attached pictures in this email containing the damages on the property as we have noticed when we moved in.

Thank you for organising the dishwasher replacement for us. Appreciate your prompt response to that.

Also as discussed on our phone call yesterday, we have tried to replace the stove top exhaust bulbs with new ones but they are not functional so I think the problem is with the wiring of the equipment. Could you please send someone to take a look ?

One of the remote controls for the garage is not working. We replaced the battery but even with the new battery it doesnât work.

We do not have the green council bin for garden waste, could you kindly arrange for one?

There is some problem with the drain in the garden and a lot of water is getting clogged, as you have seen in the past few days it has been raining a lot and the right side of the garden has a lot of water.

Please see the pictures attached below.

Let us know if you need anything else from us.

Thanks a lot in advance for your help!

Hi Ivy,

May I please follow up on the washing machine pipe issue I had spoken to you about last week?

Itâs urgent could you please send someone to fix it ?

As mentioned earlier we tried to replace the hose and bought a pipe sealant to prevent dripping too. The issue is with the pipe head, itâs leaking despite trying many ways to fix this issue by ourselves.

We have a huge load of clothes lying around to be washed itâs gettunt very inconvenient. Please send someone to look into this ASAP.

Secondly, the stove top exhaust isnât working, there is some wiring issue, we tried replacing the bulbs as well but itâs not working. 

The dishwasher was replaced on Friday, thank you for getting that done.

Kind Regards 

Shwetha

Hi Ivy

Please find the attached Tenancy condition report.

I have also attached pictures in this email containing the damages on the property as we have noticed when we moved in.

Thank you for organising the dishwasher replacement for us. Appreciate your prompt response to that.

Also as discussed on our phone call yesterday, we have tried to replace the stove top exhaust bulbs with new ones but they are not functional so I think the problem is with the wiring of the equipment. Could you please send someone to take a look ?

One of the remote controls for the garage is not working. We replaced the battery but even with the new battery it doesnât work.

We do not have the green council bin for garden waste, could you kindly arrange for one?

There is some problem with the drain in the garden and a lot of water is getting clogged, as you have seen in the past few days it has been raining a lot and the right side of the garden has a lot of water.

Please see the pictures attached below.

Let us know if you need anything else from us.

Thanks a lot in advance for your help!

If
the time is not suitable for you, please kindly return all the keys &

Thank you for your feedback.

I am afraid that the cleaning has to be completed and all your belongings need to be removed before 01/04/2021.

Just quickly, would you consider continuing the tenancy if you'd like to propose a reasonable rent adjustment amount to your landlord?

Thank you in advance and looking forward to hearing from you.
