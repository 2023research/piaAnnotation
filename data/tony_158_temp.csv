Dear Google Workspace Sync user,

Thanks for installing Google Workspace Sync for Microsoft Outlook®. This software will synchronize your calendar, contacts, email, notes, tasks and domain's global address list with Google Workspace. Before you get started, there are a few things you should know about the current version of Google Workspace:

*	Your journal entries will not synchronize with Google Workspace.
*	Google Workspace Sync will initially download up to 1GB of email from the Google Workspace Server to your desktop. You can change this setting from the system tray menu. (learn more<https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/156540>). 
*	Your initial sync can take a long time, because there's a lot of email to download. To see your synchronization status, look at synchronization status in your system tray. 
*	We strongly recommend that you create an exclude rule in your antivirus software so that it does not scan any files located under %LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Google Apps Sync.

For more information, go here:

*	Google Workspace Sync User Manual<https://support.google.com/a/users/topic/23333>
*	What's different and won't sync between Microsoft Outlook® and Google Workspace<https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/6209363>

Dear Google Workspace Sync for Microsoft Outlook® user, 

You have just saved a calendar event with HTML formatting not fully compatible with Google Calendar, or exceeded the maximum Google Calendar event description length allowed.

Don't worry! Google Workspace Sync discarded the formatting and used a plain text description instead.

You can prevent this from happening again by saving your Outlook calendar events in Rich Text Format. Learn more<https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/156468#html>.

See more tips about using Outlook calendar in Best practices in Outlook Calendar<https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/156468>.

See you in Wings on Thursday afternoon. 

 

Hi ESPs, 

 

Would be good to have you in this discussion. It would be good to have wide input in terms of questions and scenarios for testing and feedback purposes.  

 

Please also consider other documents that could be included that we could feed into the ChatGPT model. 

 

Per Professor Fang, 

 

I have trained a ChatGPT model based on PDF files I downloaded from the fair trading website.

Please have a try. This is only a teaser, demonstrating the potential capabilities (with a very simple dialogue UI). ChatGPT is a paid service for this kind of Q&A, for a couple of US cents per question. 

 

I will call a meeting to collect your feedback on:

1.	How accurate the answers are
2.	What questions it cannot answer (in terms of PM's need)
3.	What other documents we have to feed the ChatGPT model
4.	What the potential uses are for PM for this kind of services

We can then lay a plan forward to develop services for PM.

Imran Ali Khan & Zahra Anwari & Janan HUSSAINI
42 Mundowey Entrance
Villawood NSW 2163

Dear Imran Ali Khan & Farima & Janan, 

Lot 162, 42 Mundowey Entrance, Villawood NSW 2163


Our records show that your rent is paid to 22/09/2023. This makes you $4,358.46 in arrears including $261.54 credit.

Your landlord has enquired and is increasingly concerned and becoming increasingly frustrated over this situation.

As a result, termination of your tenancy has been instructed. Application to NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal (NCAT) will be submitted imminently – if not yet already.

If you've submitted any rental payments from from 10/10/2023 or after receiving this email, please send through the payment confirmation as a response to clarify the situation.


Otherwise, in resolving the matter - you're required to submit payment of $4,358.46 + $660.00 to have your account reconciled and rent paid up for the corresponding period.

The payment confirmation is required in response to this email immediately.

Failure to commit to paying rent on time will result in an NCAT order, enforcing the termination of your tenancy, vacant possession of your property and your landlord will take necessary measures to re-coop any outstanding amount as a result.

Moreover, you will be registered on TRA database - which will result in you experiencing great difficulty in future rental and financial prospects.

Lastly, if you have any questions or queries - please respond to my email, I'll be happy to further explain.

Your landlord appreciates your cooperation.

Please be advised, your rent is over a fortnight over due. Your landlord has suggested proceeding with terminating your lease.

If this is not resolved shortly, and we do not have your commitment to rental payment, we will be terminating your lease on instruction by your landlord.


Your rent is currently 42 days in arrears; paid up to 28/09/2023 and $0.00 credit for the next period from 29/09/2023.


The last payment we've received was $1,950.00 on 04/10/2023. For your reference, attached is your complete tenancy ledger.

If you’ve submitted any rental payments from 04/10/2023 or after receiving this email, please send through the payment confirmation as a response to clarify the situation.

Otherwise, please submit the required payment of $3,900.00 + $650.00 for the next period (also due for payment) to have your account reconciled and rent paid up for the corresponding period.

Rental payments are required to be processed 3 days prior to the due date as it can take up to 3 days for any electronic payment to be cleared and received.

Please note – your Weekly rental payment $650.00 should be submitted no later than Tuesday per week / fortnight.


Once the payment for the above is processed and to avoid this issue in future - ensure your next rental payment is submitted no later than Tuesday 14/11/2023, then scheduled regularly thereafter.

Kindly note - rental arrears reminders will reflect on your permanent rental history.

If you have any questions or queries - please respond to this email, we’ll be happy to further explain.

Your landlord appreciates your cooperation.

is 24/11/2023.

Should the tenant(s) meet their commitments in the
meantime, as they may well do, we will contact you to discuss the matter and
request your instructions. If this is not the case, unless we hear from you
otherwise, we will proceed with the application for a NSW Civil &
Administrative Tribunal hearing on your behalf.

Dear Sieun Jang, 

Unit 1607/13 Angas street, Meadowbank NSW 2114


Our records show that your rent is paid to 20/10/2023. This makes you $2,340.00 in arrears including $ 0.00 credit.

Your landlord has enquired and is increasingly concerned and becoming increasingly frustrated over this situation.

As a result, termination of your tenancy has been instructed. Application to NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal (NCAT) will be submitted imminently – if not yet already.

If you've submitted any rental payments from from 3/11/2023 or after receiving this email, please send through the payment confirmation as a response to clarify the situation.


Otherwise, in resolving the matter - you're required to submit payment of $2,340.00 + $0.00 to have your account reconciled and rent paid up for the corresponding period.

The payment confirmation is required in response to this email immediately.

Failure to commit to paying rent on time will result in an NCAT order, enforcing the termination of your tenancy, vacant possession of your property and your landlord will take necessary measures to re-coop any outstanding amount as a result.

Moreover, you will be registered on TRA database - which will result in you experiencing great difficulty in future rental and financial prospects.

Lastly, if you have any questions or queries - please respond to my email, I'll be happy to further explain.

Your landlord appreciates your cooperation.

vehicles in the visitor car spaces at the property. The visitor’s space is
common property and as such parking is not allowed without consent of the
Owner's Corporation. The Owner's Corporation allows parking in that area for
genuine visitors only.

 

Please find the applicable By-law below.

 

By-Law 2 clearly states:

Vehicles

‘An owner or
occupier of a lot must not park or stand any motor or other vehicle on common
property except with the written approval of the Owner’s Corporation.”

 

The following

BV5 2XS, XPQ 282, EMD 11D, CM4 8VR, BC3 3UC, CIL 31V, EMB 92H, DVW 63T.

 

If your number plate is shown above please note that
further action may be taken if they are continually found parking in these
spaces. Please ensure residents of your unit park their car either in the
allocated space or off common property i.e. on the street.

Subject: SP 86799 - 2-4 Porter Street, RYDE, NSW, 2112 - Visitor Parking
Breach - 09.11.2023

 

Dear Owners, Agents & Residents, 

 

Our office acts as Managing Agent for the above property.

 

Further to our previous letter issued on Friday the 13th
of October, we have been advised that residents are still continuing to park
vehicles in the visitor car spaces at the property. The visitor’s space is
common property and as such parking is not allowed without consent of the
Owner's Corporation. The Owner's Corporation allows parking in that area for
genuine visitors only.

 

Please find the applicable By-law below.

 

By-Law 2 clearly states:

Vehicles

‘An owner or
occupier of a lot must not park or stand any motor or other vehicle on common
property except with the written approval of the Owner’s Corporation.”

 

The following
Number Plates have been reported as continuously parking in theses spaces: 

BDK 42M, YLH 21P, DNN 86V, DDX 88S, BV 68 XN, EMP 45J,
BV5 2XS, XPQ 282, EMD 11D, CM4 8VR, BC3 3UC, CIL 31V, EMB 92H, DVW 63T.

 

If your number plate is shown above please note that
further action may be taken if they are continually found parking in these
spaces. Please ensure residents of your unit park their car either in the
allocated space or off common property i.e. on the street.

 

Please note repeated breaches of the Strata Schemes
Management Act 2015 can result in fines of up to $1100.

 

Thank you in advance for your assistance in the above
matter.

Regards,

Dear Owners, Agents and Tenants, 

 

I hope this email finds you well. 

 

I write to bring to your attention a very important
resident information session to be held at 6:00PM on Monday, 13 November 2023. 

 

The information session will be held in the onsite community
room (located from the ground floor, down the rear stairs towards Yattenden
Cres).

 

The purpose of the information session is to provide
residents with information on the ongoing construction at Modena.

 

The topics for discussion at the meeting are as follows:

*	Introduction to the construction team;
*	Update on the Building Works Rectification Order (BWRO) and rectification works completed to date;
*	Update on future works to be completed, including duration and expected impact on residents;
*	Opportunity for residents to ask questions.

 

It is strongly encouraged that all interested parties attend
this meeting to receive updates and ask questions.

 

If you have any questions prior to the meeting, please do
not hesitate to reach out to me.

Dear Owners, Agents and Tenants, 

 

I hope this email finds you well. 

 

I write to bring to your attention a very important
resident information session to be held at 6:00PM on Monday, 13 November 2023. 

 

The information session will be held in the onsite community
room (located from the ground floor, down the rear stairs towards Yattenden
Cres).

 

The purpose of the information session is to provide
residents with information on the ongoing construction at Modena.

 

The topics for discussion at the meeting are as follows:

*	Introduction to the construction team;
*	Update on the Building Works Rectification Order (BWRO) and rectification works completed to date;
*	Update on future works to be completed, including duration and expected impact on residents;
*	Opportunity for residents to ask questions.

 

It is strongly encouraged that all interested parties attend
this meeting to receive updates and ask questions.

 

If you have any questions prior to the meeting, please do
not hesitate to reach out to me.
