Hi Jeffrey 

Regarding the phonecall that just occurred with your office. 

I was made aware by Sophia that your colleagues would be handling your emails and I called the office. Was refused 3 times to speak to your member of staff. Had to beg to get someone on the phone to speak about this issue. 

We have one week to find suitable accommodation before we are homeless essentially. Your landlords property is unliveable. 

This is an urgent enquiry and can absolutely not wait until you return from holidays on Monday as suggested by your colleagues. 

The level of service and professionalism from this office is shameful.

Hi Chiragbhai Barot 

My name is Winkie from the PIA maintenance team. Thank you for reporting this to us.

For us to address the issue please describe more of the overflowing water in the bathroom – As I can see from the photo that's some hair stuck into drain  I would suggest you buy a bottle of liquid plumber clear gel or drain turbo gel  which you could find in Woolworths or Bunnings cost around $10-$20. We could also send third-party maintenance to your place to resolve the water clogging issue which may cause additional charges.

Kind Regards

Hi Winkie 

See video of the burner where the flame gets cut out a few minutes after switching off automatically. This is a safety issue as the gas could be leaking when the valve is on

The cockroaches were sighted a couple of times in the kitchen in the last two days   so wondering if a thorough pest clean was done recently

Hi Mathews 

Thank you for your email.

For us to address issue of below 

*	Kitchen cooktop burner
*	Sighted a few cockroaches in the kitchen

We’ll require you to accurately describe what the issue is and require photos OR short video including the unit and surrounding areas for better understanding.

To mobile assessment and have the issue rectified promptly - we'll need to provide this information to the landlord and any contractor to attend.

Also  we wouldn’t want to send the incorrect tradesman to address this matter.

Thank you for your support and I am looking forward to hearing back from you.

Hi Winkie 

A quick follow up on this. When do you reckon this can be fixed? We also noticed a couple of other urgent issues as we were making the condition report 

1. One of the glass panels on the front balcony is missing. See photo attached. This is a safety risk for our 1 year old as the lock is not in place for the screen door

2. One of the stoves has not been functioning properly since we moved in

3. Could you confirm if a pest control was done recently  as we have sighted a few cockroaches kn the kitchen

Looking forward to hearing from you

Hi Mathews Jose; Ann Zachariah 

Thank you for your email.

We have requested a number of tradesmen for a quotation regarding the maintenance issue you have reported.

*	The locks to the main door and the balcony facing the front seem dislodged/damaged
*	The locks to the doors facing the rear (via laundry  rumpus and kitchen) are also flimsy and do not latch properly
*	Replace a shower head in the second bathroom upstairs is broken

Once a sufficient number of quotations have been received promptly  we will relay the outcome to the landlord for their consideration.

In the meantime  thank you for your patience.

My name is Winkie from the PIA maintenance team. Thank you for reporting this to us.

For the issue that you report to us on below; 

1. The locks to the main door and the balcony facing the front seem dislodged/damaged and pose a security risk . Would be great if you could have these replaced/fixed asap. Also  only 1 of the keys can be used to open the main door - the second doesn't work when the door is locked

2. The locks to the doors facing the rear (via laundry  rumpus and kitchen) are also flimsy and do not latch properly. Would be great if someone could have a look at the same as well 

3. The shower head in the second bathroom upstairs is broken and hard to use given the sideward leakage - is this something that can be fixed?

please send us a photo/ a short video including surrounding areas ",kevin250,kevin,15,other|other|other|other,2024-01-17 15:53:45

The tenants have encountered some personal issues and have requested the cancellation of the inspections scheduled for this weekend.

Since we are still over one month away from the vacating date  we are unable to conduct open inspections without the tenants' consent. Such inspections can only be carried out without the tenants' consent within 14 days of the vacating date.

As a result  we have rescheduled the inspection to the upcoming Wednesday and have confirmed with the tenants that this timeframe is suitable for them.

If you ever have any further enquires. Please do not hesitate to reply me directly via this email.

Have a nice day.

Yes  since the tenants are breaking the lease  they will pay the rent until 08/12/2023 PLUS one week rent as penalty.

We’ve already put the property on the market  and will keep you updated. Based on our research  the similar properties in the area should be around $750/week  rental report attached for your reference. Let me know if you wish us to adjust the price.

Thanks for the email. Can I clarify so last date of tenant would be 8th Dec plus extra 1 week fine?

Would you be able to advertise the apart as soon as possible and let us know the link/photos before you upload? Last photos were great.

In terms of market rates  is $750  the market rate or can we go higher ie. $775?

I will look around as well on market weekly rental around the area.

Hi Lisayanti ROSITA & Larry WIDJAJA

Hope you and your family are very well.

Just to let you know  your current tenants have submitted their notice to vacate on 08/12/2023.

As your tenants are breaking their lease during a fixed term agreement  they're liable for a penalty equivalent of 1 weeks rent - $650.00

In accordance with your management agency agreement  I shall commence to market your property for relet. Taking into consideration the current market  your property is likely to achieve a rental value of $750.00 per week.

Please note  once a new tenancy commences - you'll be charged a letting fee (1 week rent + GST ) and contract preparation fee ($33.00 inc  GST).

Upon the tenant's vacation we shall conduct a vacating inspection to ensure that the property condition is to the same standard as when the property was leased out fair wear and tear accepted.

Hope this information assists.

If you've any further concerns or enquiries  please don't hesitate to contact me.

Have a great weekEND!

Dear Ken 

Hope you and your family are very well.

We're in the process of conducting a rental review of your property.

Facts of the current rental market :

1. Demand and Supply in the local suburb – data collected from Realestate.com.au<https://www.realestate.com.au/>

- No properties with similar specifications are on the market for lease within 2 km

2. Vacancy – data collected from sqmresearch.com.au<http://sqmresearch.com.au/>

- The vacancy rate for the postcode Oakhurst area is 0.6%  an increase of 0.4% from Sept 2022

- The average days vacant is 3 days

- Please note  an optimal vacancy rate for landlords/investors would be less than 2.5%  whereas the effect ultimately leads to extended periods between tenancies.

Facts of the current tenancy :

1. Your current rental income is $780.00 per Weekly since 10/02/2023.

2. Tenancy commenced on 23/08/2019 and expires on 20/08/2020.

3. Rent is paid always on time until today 08/11/2023

4. Requested reasonable maintenance during the occupancy

Conclusion :

At this stage  we would recommend offering the tenant the following 

1.	remain the current rental amount
2.	offer the tenant a 6/12 month lease renewal

Reason:

1.	the current rental amount of $780.00 per Weekly is at the current market range
2.	The expected vacancy is about 1 week
3.	For keeping a good tenant and avoid potential vacancy if the tenant vacates due to excessive rent increase amount

Please note that rent can only be increased once every 12 months.

If you have any intention to sell  move in or any factors which require the tenant to move out during this time  please advise urgently.

Await your instruction to proceed further – in the absence of your express instruction  we’ll not undertake any action and reschedule the rent review to 3 months later.

If you’ve any further concerns or enquiries  please don’t hesitate to contact us.

Hope this information assists and looking forward to hearing your consideration.

Hi Jeffrey 

Hope all is well.

I want to bring to your attention leakage coming from the manhole in my dining room ceiling – once again.

Overnight 05/11 – I awoke to find the same manhole leaking again.

Can you please notify the air conditioner contractor that came out last week?

Happy to organise a day to meet him – as he was quite helpful last week.

I just wanted to ensure you were aware. 

Photo and video attached.

Cheers

Wish you are well.

​

We just noted from Unit 91 owner Amy that you stopped repairs/remedial works at the subject property due to outstanding payments.

​

As you know the property applied for a strata loan which is in progress. We are currently waiting for the drawdown approval. As long as the loan is released to the property's trust account  we must pay your invoices as a priority.

​

Amy advised that the tenant has already left the unit and she has significant financial difficulty due to the mortgage. Considering the situation  it would be much appreciated if you could please kin",andy133,andy,16,other|other|other|other,2024-01-17 20:42:09

My name is Winkie from the PIA maintenance team. Thank you for reporting this to us for the below issue;

1.	The window roller for the room adjacent to the balcony floor is not working. 

If your roller blind is having difficulty rolling up  there are some suggestions for you to try; 

Obstructions: Check for any objects or obstructions that might be blocking the movement of the blind. Clear any obstacles that could be preventing it from rolling up smoothly.

Uneven Rolling: Ensure that the blind is evenly distributed on the roller. If it is not aligned properly  it may cause uneven rolling or jamming.

Tension Adjustment: Some roller blinds have a tension adjustment mechanism. If yours has this feature  check if it needs to be adjusted to provide more or less tension for smoother rolling.

Overoiling:  Roller blinds are designed to roll in one direction. If you've been attempting to roll it up in the wrong direction  this could cause issues. Ensure you are rolling it up in the correct direction as per the manufacturer's instructions.

1.	The toilet flush key not working and toilet seat is loose 

We have requested a number of tradesmen for a quotation regarding the maintenance issue you have reported. Once a sufficient number of quotations have been received in a timely manner  we will relay the outcome to the landlord for their consideration.

1.	The water in the ensuite bathroom is taking time to flush out. 

For the water clogging issues  I would suggest you buy a bottle of liquid plumber clear gel or drain turbo gel  which you could find in Woolworths or Bunnings cost around $10-$20. We could also send third-party maintenance to your place to resolve the water clogging issue which may cause additional charges if the issue is identified as tenant misuse or the issue is caused by the tenant rather than a general fault.

Thanks

We have had issues in the past with water leaking from the roof into our apartment. We were hoping to confirm with you and our strata management  that this was not the case.
We hope to hear from you soon.

Thank you for the report. We have noticed that the main bathroom has been badly affected by mold. Could we please ask the tenant to clean it or what would you suggest to rectify this issue?

This inspection has been done once in the past calendar year. Could we have 6 monthly inspections instead so that we can be on top of future issues before it becomes a major one? Your thoughts? We hope to hear from you soon

Apologies for the late response 

I had thought my mother had sent an email.

A spare fridge part was found with some other parts that came before we moved in the apartment  and I was able to replace the fridge part safely  and still have one more spare.

Another thing that I would like to bring to attention is some paint that had come off the wall. 

I had used some adhesive to put a painting on the wall  and when I had taken the painting off  a small amount of the wall’s paint had come off.

I was wondering if there would be any spare paint  or if I could get the paint’s colour code to buy from Bunnings or a similar place.

Thank you for your response.

Subject: Re: Unit 106/25 Cowper St  PARRAMATTA - Assessment request of lights in living room

HI Winkie 

Thank you for your prompt response and attention to my concerns. I would like to bring to your attention that I had previously shared images of the non-functioning light in the living room with Reina on the 21st of November. Please refer to the attached screenshot of the email for your convenience. I have also attached the same photos to this email.

<cid:image004.jpg@01DA2781.F29582C0> 

Should you require further evidence  I am more than willing to create a video demonstrating the light failing to turn on  even after switching it on.

I'm disheartened to learn that my efforts to maintain the apartment in a satisfactory condition are being perceived as grounds for a penalty. To provide context  I attempted to contact Reina regarding the shower head issue  both via phone call (Unanswered) and text message since the email for light fixing was never looked upon. Due to the lack of response  I decided to address the matter promptly to prevent further inconvenience. Given the nature of the problem  which directly affects hygiene  I felt compelled to address it promptly to ensure a clean and sanitary living environment for all residents. I have attached a screenshot of the SMS I sent to Reina yesterday afternoon for your reference.

Regrettably  the light repair request has remained unaddressed for the past three weeks  prompting us to utilize a separate standing lamp to navigate in the dark. I hope we can find a swift resolution to these concerns.

Thank you for your understanding.

Thanks

maintenance|bathroom|wall|leaking|plumbing|other,maintenance,bathroom,"Hi 16/9-1

Hope you and your family are very well.

We are writing to inform you of a critical issue regarding the waterproofing in your unit  specifically in the main bathroom. This matter has been thoroughly investigated and confirmed by both Strata and an independent plumbing assessment.

Issue Description:

A significant waterproofing failure has been identified within your main bathroom. This failure has resulted in water penetrating through the wall and has caused mold growth inside the unit hallway cupboard.

Investigation Details:

Strata conducted a dye test in the main bathroom shower  which conclusively confirmed the waterproofing failure. According to Strata bylaws  this issue falls under the owner's responsibility  as it is inside your unit and not related to a common wall.

Recommended Course of Action:

To address this pressing concern  we have obtained two quotations for the necessary waterproofing repair work:

-    Project Maintenance NSW Pty Ltd: $3 500 + GST

-    Opcon Trades: $4 800 + GST

(Quotations attached for your reference)

Recommendation:

Given the urgency of the situation and the cost-effectiveness  we strongly recommend proceeding with Project Maintenance NSW Pty Ltd  who have provided a competitive quotation of $3 500 + GST.

Next Steps:

We kindly request your prompt approval to proceed with the selected contractor  Project Maintenance NSW Pty Ltd. Once approved  we will immediately coordinate the repair work to mitigate further damage to your property.

If you ever have any further enquires. Please do not hesitate to reply me directly via this email.

Have a nice day.

I do apologise about the late response. 

I haven’t gotten the chance to take a video/photos of the kitchen or blinds in the bedroom but I will have them with you this evening 

I have sent over the rent and in it I included the $10.65 for the water charge last month. (Please see attached photo). I hope this is okay 

In regards with bills  how do we go about paying the electricity  gas etc? Do you just send an email like the water one or is there a certain company we have to set up with?

Good Morning Andy 

Hope you had a lovely weekend😀

Yes all the below were carried out and fixed. The workers were very professional and a delight to have in our home. However I did ask if they could fix a few other things but they informed me they were not on the list.

The blinds in the bedroom are still unable to close/open properly and they informed me that we may need new blinds altogether. 

Two bits of wood in the kitchen - above and below the oven are broke  are we able to get them fixed also? 

We told them about the extractor fan above the cooker   again they had a look at it and advised me we might need a new one altogether. 

Not sure if they had mentioned any of the above to yourself so I thought it would be best too. 

If you require any photos or more information I am happy to share.

Have a good week😃

Can you please arrange someone to come and fix our front gate and back screen door (photos attached). 

The front gate is loose and the part keeps falling off the gate  so we have taped it so it allows us to close the gate. We did go to Bunnings and buy new screws for the gate but it seems it needs a new part.

The back door part is also loose and now getting stuck when we try to open/close the door.

Hello both 

I'm very pleased to confirm that the carpet has finally been replaced! See attached before & after videos. I can't praise Crowsnest Floorwood  Jaye and Mohamed enough - so professional throughout and an excellent result.

The hole in the wall still needs patching  photo attached. If you could let me know when that's scheduled  that would be great. That will be everything closed off.

Jeffrey  The skirting boards weren't replaced or treated so I've cleaned as best I can. I've gotten most of the water marks off the wall too. See photos below.

Regards 

Catherina

Hope you are well. 

I wanted to provide you with an update on the ongoing defect issue at the property. The carpet concern has been addressed  and a new one has been installed. For your convenience  please find an attached video showcasing the completed work. The tenant expresses great satisfaction with the new carpet.

Regarding other outstanding matters  the hole in the wall is scheduled for patching  and the replacement of the skirting is still pending. The builder has arranged with the tenant to address these issues on Wednesday  22/11/2023. I will ensure to keep you informed of any further developments.

Regarding the proposed rental increase  the tenant is grateful for the offer of a 2-month delay. However  she initially sought a 7-month postponement. In a spirit of compromise  she is now willing to agree to a 4-month delay  with the increased rent taking effect from 1st May 2024. This decision stems from her appreciation of the efforts made by both our team and you as the owner  as well as the positive outcome she has observed.

Please let me know your thought.

If you ever have any further enquires. Please do not hesitate to reply me directly via this email.

Have a nice day.

HI Jeffrey   

It was lovely chatting to you today regarding my apartment.

I am very pleased with your update that the water leak repairs will be finally done this Friday.

As per our discussion I had planned to increase the rental by $50 to $800 per week as of January 2024  however as a gesture of good will to the Tennant for putting up with theatre damage  I am prepared to

delay the rental increase until March 2024 next year.

Could you please also forward me images of the repaired work once it is done this Friday 10th November.

Thank you for your information.

The owner is very pleased that the water leak repairs are finally done. As for the rent increase  there was a plan to increase the rent by $50  making it $800 per week starting from January 2024. However  in consideration of the inconveniences caused by the ongoing repairs  the owner decided to extend a gesture of goodwill.

Instead of implementing the rental increase in January  she is willing to delay it until March 2024. This adjustment is intended to express appreciation for your understanding and patience during this period.

Please let me know whether you would accept the offer from the owner. Thank you for your understanding.

If you ever have any further enquires. Please do not hesitate to reply me directly via this email.

Have a nice day.

Kind Regards

Hello both 

I'm very pleased to confirm that the carpet has finally been replaced! See attached before & after videos. I can't praise Crowsnest Floorwood  Jaye and Mohamed enough - so professional throughout and an excellent result.

The hole in the wall still needs patching  photo attached. If you could let me know when that's scheduled  that would be great. That will be everything closed off.

Jeffrey  The skirting boards weren't replaced or treated so I've cleaned as best I can. I've gotten most of the water marks off the wall too. See photos below.

Regards 

Catherina

Hi Winkie 

A quick follow up on this. When do you reckon this can be fixed? We also noticed a couple of other urgent issues as we were making the condition report 

1. One of the glass panels on the front balcony is missing. See photo attached. This is a safety risk for our 1 year old as the lock is not in place for the screen door

2. One of the stoves has not been functioning properly since we moved in

3. Could you confirm if a pest control was done recently  as we have sighted a few cockroaches kn the kitchen

Looking forward to hearing from you

Hi Mathews Jose; Ann Zachariah 

Thank you for your email.

We have requested a number of tradesmen for a quotation regarding the maintenance issue you have reported.

*	The locks to the main door and the balcony facing the front seem dislodged/damaged
*	The locks to the doors facing the rear (via laundry  rumpus and kitchen) are also flimsy and do not latch properly
*	Replace a shower head in the second bathroom upstairs is broken

Once a sufficient number of quotations have been received promptly  we will relay the outcome to the landlord for their consideration.

In the meantime  thank you for your patience.

My name is Winkie from the PIA maintenance team. Thank you for reporting this to us.

For the issue that you report to us on below; 

1. The locks to the main door and the balcony facing the front seem dislodged/damaged and pose a security risk . Would be great if you could have these replaced/fixed asap. Also  only 1 of the keys can be used to open the main door - the second doesn't work when the door is locked

2. The locks to the doors facing the rear (via laundry  rumpus and kitchen) are also flimsy and do not latch properly. Would be great if someone could have a look at the same as well 

3. The shower head in the second bathroom upstairs is broken and hard to use given the sideward leakage - is this something that can be fixed?

please send us a photo/ a short video including surrounding areas for better understanding. To mobile assessment and have the issue rectified promptly - we'll need to provide this information to the landlord and any contractor to attend. Also  this can avoid sending the incorrect contractor to address this matter.

4. One of the garage door is also not functioning via the remote control and can only be open manually - please kindly replace the battery by yourself that may resolve the issue. 

Please do let us know how you go after changing the battery.

The tenant reported that the “ store room door lock is not able to lock with keys or without keys “. I suggested they twist to lock it before walking out and closing the door. The tenant responded from the email  that they had tried it and still not working and requested a tradesman.

Hi Supreet Singh 

Thank you for your email.

For the store room lock that you have reported to us  after investigating from the video. It is not supposed to lock with the key there is a locking mechanism on the inside lock  and you twist to lock it before walking out and closing the door behind you. Sort of like a front entry door to a house. That’s how it locks. And the keys can only open the lock. Please double check the inside of the door lock to check if there is a mechanism and try lock it from there. If it doesn’t  please send a photo back of the back of the door lock. 

Please do let us know how you go after trying.

Hi Nextgen

Hope all is well.

The tenant reported a number of issues related the subject property:

*	Front door lock not working and door not aligned with frame. We suspect the lock is not working due to the misalignment (photo attached)
*	Front door leaking when raining
*	Leaking through the bedrooms windows when raining

This unit is located at the top floor.

Can you kindly advise in relation to the following:

*	Is the front door strata or owner responsibility?
*	Being this unit on the top floor  does strata have to investigate the leaks?

Hi Jeenat Alam; Quazi Ashifuzzaman 

Thank you for your email.

For us to address issue of Aircon and dishwasher spray arm is not working – we’ll require you to send us a photos OR short video including the unit and surrounding areas for better understanding.

Dishwasher spray arm - I will suggest you to remove the spray arm and clean it thoroughly  by using a soft brush or toothpick to clear any blockages. Over time  debris  food particles  or mineral deposits can accumulate and clog the spray arm's nozzles. Please do let me know how you go after cleaning. 

To mobile assessment and have the issue rectified in a timely manner - we'll need to provide this information to the landlord and any contractor to attend.

Also  we wouldn’t want to send the incorrect tradesman to address this matter.

Hi Shivangi Saxena 

My name is Winkie from the PIA maintenance team. Thank you for reporting this to us.

For us to address the issue of dishwasher is not working  have you check for any tripped circuit breakers or blown fuses in your home's electrical panel ? turn off the dishwasher using the power button or by unplugging it for a few minutes and Then  turn it back on and try to start a new cycle or press the ""Pause"" or ""Cancel"" button (if available) to cancel the current cycle. Then try selecting a new program and pressing the start button again.

Please do let us know you go after trying those suggestion.

I've included for you the quotations and suggestions for the recent maintenance issues I've identified. 

The tenant reported that a “ faulty dishwasher is not responding when lights are turning on and button (press/start/cancel) is not functioning. “ I have suggested tenant check for any tripped circuit breakers or blown fuses in your home's electrical panel and restart again for the new dishwasher”. However  the tenant's response is still not working and requests for a tradesman to do an inspection.

There are some quotes I have asked for;

Best Repairs - $250 – 350 pre-approvals with 12-month warranty

Thank you for your email.

As per attached photo  there is a rangehood/exhaust fan at the kitchen.

You may simply pull it out and you will see 2 x switches inside on both sides controlling the light & fan capacity respectively.

Regarding the removal hook  please use a reliable brand otherwise the residue will leave on the wall which is considered as damage.

Hope the information assists and have a good week!

Apologies for the late response 

I had thought my mother had sent an email.

A spare fridge part was found with some other parts that came before we moved in the apartment  and I was able to replace the fridge part safely  and still have one more spare.

Another thing that I would like to bring to attention is some paint that had come off the wall. 

I had used some adhesive to put a painting on the wall  and when I had taken the painting off  a small amount of the wall’s paint had come off.

I was wondering if there would be any spare paint  or if I could get the paint’s colour code to buy from Bunnings or a similar place.

Thank you for your response.

你好， 

烤箱的电闸是已经拨上去的状态，应该是开了。我找不到烤箱的插头，可能跟空调一样，是被遮住了，看不到。刚才我又去试了一下烤箱，依然还是没有反应。

因为我上班期间电话没有信号，所以你打不通，你可以拨打0478299353，这是我妻子电话，她都可以接听，

另外能不能以后发邮件的时候新增抄送一个邮箱lazycat.lan19@gmail.com<mailto:另外能不能以后发邮件的时候新增抄送一个邮箱lazycat.lan19@gmail.com>， 或者直接就在系统改成这个，这是我来澳洲后申请的gmail邮箱，会及时看到，163的会有延迟。

Hi  Brian

有两点需要和您特别提出：

1. 烤箱我们试过很多次都无法把它开启， 旁边右边柜子有个插座是灶台的，左边柜子没有插座。

2. 小房的衣柜推拉门推不动，我们看了只要拿个合适的螺丝，扭进去，把轮子顶到导轨上就可以了。衣柜门是经常要推拉的，这点很影响使用。

<cid:image003.png@01DA2850.3BAC4010><cid:image004.png@01DA2850.3BAC4010>

就麻烦你跟进下这两件事情，谢谢。

Hi Andy 

I am writing this email to formalize what we just talked.

I don’t agree with the owners decision  I wasn’t even home when the accident happened. As you can see in the photo  the door handle came loose and consequently the glass fell to the floor. So  please  I kindly ask you to talk to the owner again  because it wasn’t our fault  and and do not think it fair we pay around 300$. 

Please ask her/him to consider that the rent has just increased and consequently all other things have also increased  supermarket  water  electricity…etc  and etc.

So  again  please  wasn’t our fault  believe it. 

Thank you.

Hi Leticia 

Thank you for your email.

After a lengthy conversation with the landlord  they doubt the causation reason that the shattered oven glass is hard to break by itself without any external force.

Since it is hard to determine  the landlord proposes to share the cost of replacing the glass in 50% + 50% - see the attached quotation for a glass replacement of $626.53 in total.

Once confirmed  I can act further.

Hope the information assists and looking forward to hearing from you.

Hi Md Makhsusur Rahman Bhuiyan 

Thank you for your email. 

For the water clogging issues from the kitchen sink  I would suggest you buy a bottle of liquid plumber clear gel or drain turbo gel  which you could find in Woolworths or Bunnings cost around $10-$20. We could also send third-party maintenance to your place to resolve the water clogging issue which may cause additional charges. 

Please note  that the tenant should be responsible for the repair cost if the issue is identified as tenant misuse or the issue is caused by the tenant rather than a general fault.

Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

the sink is always gets blocked even when we unclog it.
even just water makes it clogged.

below the sink the pipes are leaking water and we put bucket so floor doesnt get wet.

Outside the drain sometimes gets overflowed but not all the time.

Hi Md Makhsusur Rahman Bhuiyan 

My name is Winkie from the PIA maintenance team. Thank you for reporting this to us.

For us to address the issue please describe more of the leak in the kitchen sink – we’ll require photos or short videos of the issue including surrounding areas for better understanding. To conduct a mobile assessment and have the issue rectified promptly  we'll need to provide this information to the landlord and any contractor to attend.

Please take measures to mitigate further damage. Could you place towels or containers to collect water and  if safe  identify the source of the leakage?

It's been almost 2 weeks since my dryer gave up. The guy last Thursday just came to inspect and give quotation. You said that the owner are willing to give a brand new dryer.

Hi Noha Magdy Abdelmoneim Mohamed & Mohamed Ahmed Mahmoud Ahmed Abouzeid 

My name is Winkie from the PIA maintenance team. Thank you for reporting this to us.

For us to address the issue  please help us to clarify the issue from the noise made by the dryer  is the dryer function but just making the noise? 

Please do check the drum and the space between the drum and the dryer's housing for any foreign objects such as coins  buttons  or small items that may be causing the noise. Before drying clothes  make sure there are no loose items like keys  screws  or other hard objects in the pockets of the clothes. These items can create noise as they tumble in the dryer.

If those suggestion that you have made and the noise still coming from the dryer  we can arrange a tradesperson to look at the issue If the problem is due to daily use and doesn't require maintenance attention  you're covering the visit and replacement costs  as per our agreement. Do you want to proceed?

Hello Tony 

The ac unit is not working properly since past 2 days. The thermostat is recording wrong temperature and the ac is nearly cooling. As you know it’s peak summer and therefore it’s creating problems. Can you please look into this ?! 

Also the laundry room exhaust seems to be not working properly. Good ventilation is required in that area else the moulds will start if we neglect it any further. 

Looking forward to hearing from you

﻿Hi Rain 

We have several issues with the property that need immediate attention. Over the past 2 weeks we have identified and thoroughly observed the following issues below which are interrupting our daily operations :

- Dishwasher doesn’t work  cannot wash dishes - shows E4 error code after power cycling on.
- Air conditioner stops working after several minutes - shows E8 error code and control panel is broken  hanging by the wires. Needs new wall mount case.
- kitchen sink pipe leaking into cupboard.
- Ensuite bathroom sink clogged - water doesn’t drain. 
- Laundry exhaust fan and light are not working causing paint to peel off door frame from lack of heat extraction. (Updated photo attached.)

- Intercom doesn’t work. Cannot hear or see visitors at all. The building manager has confirmed it must be fixed immediately.

- Electricity bill not paid by previous tenant for the last 3 years!! I now have to sort out and have thousands of dollars removed from my account and provide a copy of my lease to not be charged for it.

Please find photos attached.

Subject: Maintenance items for repair - Unit 105 9 Edwin Street Mortlake

Hello Leon 

I hope you’re well. I have some maintenance items that need repairing. As you know I take really good care of the place  but these items listed below are essentially “wear & tear”.

Items are as follows:

Image ending 3289 – Downlight in the laundry doesn’t work. The laundry builds up so much steam that some of the paint is peeling off. The fan in the laundry is basically useless. I try leaving all the windows open etc… however  I have been here for just about four years (Would have been worse if someone else was here) and it seems to be “wear and tear”. 

Image ending 3291 – URGENT item for fixing the handle and bolt in the locking mechanism has collapsed. I can’t open the door for fear of it not closing. It is a common issue with these doors as I have been told by other residents.

Image ending 3292 – The ensuite bathroom mirror. Once again  the fans in this place do the bare minimum in keeping steam out. I do the best I can in managing it  so the place doesn’t damage  but over time I notice the mirrors are getting damage and the paint behind the ensuite bathroom door is peeling off. This isn’t urgent but I thought the owner should know – as it should be a building problem. A lot of people have similar issues here. 

Image ending 3290 – This is the main door on level one. The door handle is becoming loose  and I want to notify you before it becomes a security issue. Once again “wear & tear”. 

Image ending 3288 – URGENT This blind upstairs has broken again. It is the same one that fell a couple of years ago. 

Other items:

The dishwasher isn’t working the best and may need a service. As mentioned  I take the best care and periodically complete deep cleans etc … so it just needs some sort of maintenance.

The ducted air-conditioning – Could you notify the owner that I have been here for four years and there has been no clean or maintenance on the air-conditioning? To preserve the life-cycle I just wanted to check if there was some sort of routine maintenance required?

As always  thank you for your help. Let me know if you need any further information. 

I will be home for tomorrow’s property inspection.

Thank you.

Regards 

Angelina

Hi Andy  

I’m sorry for the late reply. I’ve been busy lately with my night shift work. 

I have assessed the bathroom fan  it seemed working but just not that strong suctioning. 

The main problem will be the lights  curtain rod and leakage of the bathroom tap. It’s just constantly leaks out  therefore very prone to get water damage as well as inconveniences. I have attached short video and pics.

Pls let me know what you think.

Thank you for your returned condition report.

For us to address issue concerning the following items - we’ll require you to provide photos OR a short video including the unit and surrounding areas for better understanding.

*	Bathroom - the exhaust fan is not working - request a short video by using a tissue shutting the vent in order to identify the suction as it is a ducted system and you may not hear the running noise.
*	Bathroom - tap leaks  require a short video

To mobile assessment and have the issue rectified in a timely manner - we'll need to provide this information to the landlord and any contractor to attend.

Also  we wouldn’t want to send the incorrect tradesman to address this matter.

maintenance|living room|other|other|other|other,maintenance,living room,"Dear Andy 

I trust this email finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss a concern regarding the unit we currently reside in. As you are aware  Sydney experiences high humidity levels  creating an ideal environment for mold growth and proliferation. Mold not only poses health risks to humans  potentially causing irreversible damage to our lungs  but it also leads to unsightly discoloration and stains on various interior surfaces of buildings  including walls and ceilings.

Regrettably  our unit is not exempt from this issue  and we find ourselves contending with it daily. In our attempts to mitigate the problem  we have ventilated the unit by opening windows. However  this has introduced a new challenge  as the absence of window screens allows various insects and flies to enter and disturb us.

In light of this  we kindly request the landlord to consider implementing a solution by installing window screens. This measure would serve the dual purpose of preventing insects from entering while also safeguarding the unit against mold damage. Given that there are only two windows  we believe the cost of installation would not be prohibitively high. The positive impact on our quality of life would  however  be significant.

We appreciate your attention to this matter and hope for a prompt resolution.

Sincerely 
Pezhman

Hi Amy 

Hope all's well. 

The tenant is wondering if you would consider installing fly screens for the property as the weather is getting warmer so they can have better ventilation which also helps to avoid potential mould issues inside the property.

*they are only requesting to have the fly screen in the living room.

Based on the request  I’ve sourced fly screen tradesman able to install standard wire mesh fly screens at a discounted price and below-market prices with frame colour in keeping with the current aesthetics of the complex. 

The cost is:

-     $350.00 each (single) sliding door fly screen section.

-     Red for sliding door

By considering the feature above  the total cost will be at $350.00

The flyscreen supplier offers PIA customers a 10% discount and the final quotation will be $280.00 in total

To proceed  simply respond to this email and we’ll arrange it accordingly.

Once complete  we’ll provide photos of the completed work and arrange for payment of the invoice to be submitted from your rental income.

Hope this information assists and looking forward to hearing back from you.

Hi Isabella 

Kindly find enclosed a signed copy of the document  after inspection. I will forward pictures as well. However  the place is pretty much the same as the pictures posted on the site…with some stuff sorted here and there. 

We have replaced the fittings for the pieces of the blind that was missing. We have tried to clean wherever possible  but some rust stains won’t budge. We have tightened some stuff that was loose. One of the plates aren’t working  it’s the back right hand side  the flame won’t come on for some reason. Think it may have something to do with the starter. The stove has water marks/stains seemingly there to stay. Unable to comment on both balconies at the moment  due to the builders still working…however  should there be anything out of the ordinary  I shall add it in and forward pictures at a later stage. 

Thank You. 

Kind Regards

Anthony & Crystall Paul

I hope you're well. 

I'm writing as our air conditioner just started leaking water from the bottom of the unit. Please see attached photos. 

We have turned off the unit for now and placed a towel and container under the leak. 

But if this could be looked into this would be greatly appreciated.

I have contacted the air con technician and he has confirmed that he can move the a/c unit just around the corner without having to move the pipes. Therefore  no need to involved Strata. Guy the Building Manager has confirmed this also.  

The technician will just wrap the new pipes around the corner at the same level and put the unit in the shade. 

Can you please get approval from the owner to have the UNIT  at my cost.

This heat isn't pleasant I must say.... 

Can you please represent me to the owner in a positive way. I am trying to reduced my energy costs by moving to the shade  as I do plan to be here for some time.....

Can you please advise the tenants to try this procedure to unlock the controller:

How to cancel:

Hold down “ENTER” button for 3 seconds  the buzzer beeps 4 times indicating the setting is cancelled and ‘the locked symbol’ will disappear from the LCD  indicating that the button locked function has been cancelled.

Hi Winkie

I have shared the
photos and videos of the water leakage with Tony. 

The water doesn’t
come out immediately  and it is after a usage of between 20-25 mins or
so. 

There was no error
code shown on the AC. 

I have looked at
the filter and it appears to be clean from outside (as per your advice) and so
I didn’t touch any further  as I no knowledge of AC and don’t want to try
something that I am not aware of.

I am not sure  if
you are aware that I moved into the property just 6-7 weeks ago and didn’t
needed to turn on the AC so far until earlier this week  when heat starting
gearing up. So I am surprised  if it needs to be deep cleaned or anything as
yet? 

Today it is going
to be extremely hot weather  is it possible to get someone assigned to have a
look at it? 

Sam  wasn’t
reachable when I called him up yesterday. 

PS: usually this is
due to the clogged/damaged draining pipe or problem with evaporator coils.

Your help is
greatly appreciated.

Hi Archit

Thank you
for your email.

For us to
address issue of the AC– we’ll require you to accurately describe what the
issue is and require photos OR short video including the unit and
surrounding areas for better understanding. As recently you have turn on the AC
after a long time  I would suggest you to buy a new filter
with similar one which you could find in Bunnings. Regular maintenance 
including cleaning  can prolong the life of your air conditioner and improve
its efficiency. We could also send third-party maintenance to your place to do
a deep cleaning of air conditioner which may cause additional charges

Please
let me how you go after trying and did it show any error code on the control
panel on AC.

To mobile
assessment and have the issue rectified in a timely manner - we'll need to
provide this information to the landlord and any contractor to attend.

Also  we

Hi Reina 

Writing to follow up on the repairs of the Air Conditioning (AC).

Regards 

Sumit & Shradha.

Hi Rain 

Thank you for your email.

The lock problem is not related to locking pin.

Actually  the lever itself is not closing with door handle- only close partially and therefore  sometime not able to open door. 

With little struggle  I manage to open it with small screw driver. But  the problem is not locking mechanism  its lock itself.

Please see the attached videos.

Please help resolving it.

Hi Tjong Li San & EDY SUNARTO 

My name is Winkie from the PIA maintenance team. Thank you for reporting this to us.

To address the issue  please describe more about how the exhaust fan is not working - could you try it by using a tissue holding on the top and switch on the fan to see if any air is coming out or any sound? 

We have requested a number of tradesmen for a quotation regarding the maintenance issue you have reported for the shower pipe leaking  once a sufficient number of quotations have been received in a timely manner  we will relay the outcome to the landlord for their consideration.

For the ceiling lights is tenant responsibility to do the replacement  you can refer to the below link that teaches you how to change the ceiling lights;

Thank you for your email. Could you please check for the hot water level in your unit by below steps;

If you have an electric hot water system  check the fuse box marked with hot water to make sure that it's functioning properly. Check also that the power cord of the hot water heaters is plugged in correctly and the PowerPoint is turned on.

If you have a tankless water heater  it might be struggling to keep up with the demand. Make sure the temperature setting on the water heater is appropriate. 

Please send some photos for us to address the issue and let me know how you go after checking for your side.

Subject: Urgent: PowerPoints not working

Good afternoon Tony 

I hope you are well. I just wanted to bring to your urgent attention that the electrical PowerPoints in Unit 136 are not working. They have been down since late yesterday afternoon. 

As a result  we are unable to charge any devices  use the computer   wi-fi  hair dryer  etc which has significant implications on daily living and working at home.

Only the lights and stove are working in our apartment.

If you could provide a way forward for this to be looked at ASAP  that would be great.

In addition  our air conditioner has not been working for over a month now. In a previous email  you had mentioned someone was going to come look at it but they never came. As we head towards summer with already increasing temperatures  we would like this issue to be fixed as soon as possible.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Warm regards 

Monica

Dear Chia-Wei & Long 

Subject: Strengthening Property Protection: Opting for Terri Scheer as our Insurer

Addresss: Unit 1201/153 Parramatta Road  Homebush NSW 2140

 I hope this message finds you in good health and spirits. As we continue to oversee our property investment  I recently came across a significant detail regarding the insurance policy for the property. I believe it's crucial that we address this matter promptly to ensure the best possible protection for our investment.

Upon reviewing the current status of our property insurance  I noticed that the policy is not currently managed through our preferred channels. This discovery prompted me to delve deeper into the insurance options available to us  particularly those tailored to property owners like us.

After thorough research and consideration  I'm writing to strongly recommend that we choose Terri Scheer as our insurer for the property. Terri Scheer specializes in insurance solutions for landlords and property owners  and their expertise aligns seamlessly with our unique needs and goals.

Here's why I believe opting for Terri Scheer is a wise decision:

1.	Tailored Landlord Insurance: Terri Scheer offers specialized landlord insurance policies designed to address the specific risks and challenges that property owners face. Their policies extend beyond conventional homeowners' insurance to provide comprehensive coverage for tenant-related issues  property damages  and legal protection.
2.	Proven Track Record: With over 30 years of experience in the industry  Terri Scheer has earned a reputation for reliability and excellence. Their expertise in landlord insurance equips us with a partner who truly understands the intricacies of property ownership.
3.	Loss of Rental Income Coverage: Terri Scheer's policies often include coverage for the loss of rental income in case the property becomes temporarily uninhabitable due to covered damages. This feature ensures that our revenue stream remains uninterrupted during unforeseen disruptions.
4.	Tenant-Related Protection: Terri Scheer's policies address tenant-related risks  including damages caused by tenants  rental default  and legal expenses incurred during tenant disputes. This level of protection minimizes potential financial setbacks and ensures our investment remains financially viable.
5.	Dedicated Support: Terri Scheer offers professional assistance throughout the insurance process  from selecting the right policy to filing claims. This support streamlines our insurance management and enhances our peace of mind.

Given the aforementioned advantages  I genuinely believe that partnering with Terri Scheer will optimize our property insurance coverage and contribute to the overall success of our investment.

I kindly request your consideration of this recommendation. I'm more than willing to initiate the process and facilitate the transition to Terri Scheer as our insurer. Your trust and confidence in this decision are of utmost importance  and I'm committed to ensuring a seamless and informed transition.

If you do have an insurance policy for the property  please forward me a copy of the policy for records.

Thank you for your email.

Please send us the below payment details from the new owner for rental adjustment.

Bank name:

Account name:

Account number:

BSB:

For your reference  the tenant is currently in arrears for 24 days and a termination order from NCAT was obtained the termination date was 09/10/2023.

However  the current owner agreed to keep the tenancy if the rent can be caught up and the tenant also agreed to pay 2-week rent on a weekly basis.

By today  I have contacted the tenant to vacate the property no later than 06/12/2023 due to the property sold as well as the termination order is still valid due to arrears.

Please relay the information to the new owner and come to collect the files & keys from our office at 2 Australia Avenue  Sydney Olympic Park from 07/12/2023 between 10:00 - 5:30 PM with a minimum 2 hours notice.

Hope the information assists.

(Administrators Appointed) - Second Meeting of Creditors

Dear Owners and Agents 

Apologies for the delayed email on this issue.

We were only alerted of this meeting taking place
yesterday.

We have sought legal advice and here is advice
received for the lot owners 

*	It is up to individual owners whether to lodge a proof of debt (separate to the proof of debt submitted by the Owners Corporation). 
*	The potential loss to lot owners (as identified by the external administrator in their email) may be:
*	loss suffered from investment income as they would rent at a lower price or not be able to rent their apartments at all; and
*	loss suffered in decline in the value of their apartments due to the rectification works required on the Property.

*	There is no requirement for lot owners to lodge a separate proof of debt and it is voluntary for them to be involved in the process
*	If there is any doubt  we recommend the lot owners to seek their own legal advice. 

We are
attending the meeting on behalf of the Owners Corporation.

Subject: Second Creditors Meeting of JKN Airway Pty Ltd

Hi Tets  

We refer to the external administration of JKN Airway Pty
Ltd  who is the developer entity for SP 95322. 

Earlier this morning I attended the second creditors meeting
for JKN Airway as instructed. The main purpose of this meeting is to determine
the next steps for JKN Airway and to vote on whether to approve the external
administrator/liquidators costs. 

Outcome of Second Creditor Meeting

We confirm the following outcomes were voted on and approved
at the meeting:

*	That JKN Airway Pty Ltd be placed into liquidation
*	That all of the external administrator’s incurred costs and liquidator’s future costs (up to a capped amount) be approved. 

Short summary of second creditor’s report

Please see attached a copy of the second creditor’s
report for JKN Airway Pty Ltd. In brief:

*	Based on the documents available at this stage  the external administrator is unable to determine any potential dividends available to the creditors in liquidation. The company does not appear to have any significant assets.
*	Based on the lack of assets at this stage  the developer company in liquidation is unlikely to return any significant dividend to creditors like the Owners Corporation
*	The liquidator may be able to recover additional assets however it will need to undertake further investigations during liquidation. 

The above is somewhat expected  but disappointing
nonetheless. 

The liquidator will now undertake their investigations and
will prepare a further report to creditors in due course. The Owners
Corporation does not need to do anything further during this period and can let
the liquidators do what they need to do. 

External administrator / liquidator’s costs

In relation to the external administrator/liquidator’s fees 
they will be recovered out of the assets of the company. If the company has no
assets then the external administrator/liquidator will not be paid. The Owners
do not have any obligation towards the external administrator/liquidator’s
fees. There may be circumstances where the liquidator asks for funding in the
future but that will require further instructions and approval from the
creditors. 

Lot Owners’ separate proof of debt

I understand the external administrator had sent out notices
to many lot owners. In this respect our comments are:

*	It is up to individual lot owners whether to lodge a separate proof of debt (separate to the proof of debt submitted by the Owners Corporation). 
*	The potential loss to lot owners (as identified by the external administrator in their email) may be:
*	loss suffered from inv",ray260,ray,39,other|other|other|other,2024-01-17 19:45:23

Hi Lyn

The tenant has now reported that the ceiling in the kitchen is also showing possible signs of water ingress (photo attached).

Can I have an update as to when the works will be done and the whole in the ceiling of the ensuite bathroom will be repaired?

The tenant will be away for a period over the holidays and will not be able to monitor the situation which from what I see could get worse and cause further damage?

Would appreciate this be followed up and actioned URGENTLY.

Please respond with an update ASAP.

I've included for you the quotations and suggestions for the recent maintenance issues I've identified. 

The tenant reported a “bee hole outside the unit building. “ I will suggest removing the entire bee hole for long-term benefits and safety issues instead of just killing all the bees for temporarily as will come back again.

There are some quotes I have asked for;

Reliance Pest Management - Treatment + removal of bees = $440 including GST (3 month guarantee)

Flick Pest control = $2395 + GST (Bees removal service to the front façade of the 3 storey building  located at the weep holes close to the car ramp down. Service includes seal the weep holes which use for the access of the bees).

Info Pestige Solutions = $300 - $460+GST

I am writing to bring to your attention  the Resident of Unit 905 (Lot 107) has not Cleaned up after her Dog Urinated in the Garden Common Area. I immediately spoke to the Cleaners to have the affected Area Cleaned and Sanitized. 

I then checked CCTV Footage and found this incident occurred on the 9 Nov at 8:00pm – After hours. As this occurred after hours I also checked for other instances and found the same occurred on the 8th Nov and 6th Nov. 

Please be aware  this appears to be an ongoing issue  and I have issued the Resident a Dog Urine Notice.

Dear Residents 

We hope you are well.

Recently  we have observed instances where the lids of our rubbish bins were left open after disposal  which has unfortunately attracted birds that pick apart the rubbish  creating a mess around the bins and the surrounding areas. The specific unit has been identified and further action is in process with this unit.

We kindly request the cooperation of all residents in ensuring that the lids of the bins are securely closed after disposing of your rubbish. This small action goes a long way in maintaining the cleanliness and overall appearance of our community. It also helps prevent the spread of litter and discourages pests  such as birds  from being attracted to the bins.

Here are a few simple steps to help us all maintain a clean and pleasant living environment:

Close the Lid: After placing your rubbish in the bins  please ensure that the lid is fully closed. Avoid overfilling the bins or leaving items protruding from the top.

Recycling: Remember to separate recyclables from general rubbish and place them in the designated recycling bins. This helps reduce waste and promotes recycling in our community.

Dispose Responsibly: If you have items that are too large for the bins or require special disposal  consider alternative methods such as arranging a council cleanup or contacting a waste removal service.

By working together and being mindful of our waste disposal practices  we can keep our community clean  attractive  and free from the inconvenience of scattered rubbish. We appreciate your assistance in this matter and thank you for being responsible members of our community.

If you have any questions or need further information about waste disposal guidelines  please do not hesitate to contact our property management team.

Let's make a collective effort to maintain a clean and welcoming environment for everyone. Your cooperation is invaluable in achieving this goal.

Thank you for your attention and support.

I hope you are well and having a great day. 

I am writing to bring to your attention  the Resident of Unit 905 (Lot 107) has not Cleaned up after her Dog Urinated in the Garden Common Area. I immediately spoke to the Cleaners to have the affected Area Cleaned and Sanitized. 

I then checked CCTV Footage and found this incident occurred on the 9 Nov at 8:00pm – After hours. As this occurred after hours I also checked for other instances and found the same occurred on the 8th Nov and 6th Nov. 

Please be aware  this appears to be an ongoing issue  and I have issued the Resident a Dog Urine Notice.

Please refer Vids attached.

If any further details needed  please feel free to contact me on 0423 284 174.

Hi Isabella 

Kindly find enclosed a signed copy of the document  after inspection. I will forward pictures as well. However  the place is pretty much the same as the pictures posted on the site…with some stuff sorted here and there. 

We have replaced the fittings for the pieces of the blind that was missing. We have tried to clean wherever possible  but some rust stains won’t budge. We have tightened some stuff that was loose. One of the plates aren’t working  it’s the back right hand side  the flame won’t come on for some reason. Think it may have something to do with the starter. The stove has water marks/stains seemingly there to stay. Unable to comment on both balconies at the moment  due to the builders still working…however  should there be anything out of the ordinary  I shall add it in and forward pictures at a later stage. 

Thank You.

Few things to mention;

1.       Typo in point 8 of  ‘New tenancy agreement commencing on 06/11/2023’ should be 07/11/2023.

2.       Wudi’s email in replying tenant Amrik’s construction compliant in point 5 mentioned ‘repair defect in the balconies’  which I am not sure if it can cause any issue.

3.       Terri Scheer claim manager is Corinne T which details can be found in third email received on 03/11/23 as attached. Other two emails were received on 19/10/23 and 20/11/23 respectively. Third email has requested the least documents than other two emails that I am not sure is meant good or bad.

4.       Carpet estimator appointment was done on 24/10/23 as attached screen shot which booked by Terri Scheer.

We can wait until the end date of the contract  but if we transfer the contract to someone else  would we still have to pay a fine?

Thank you for your email.

Your fixed term lease is until 10/5/2024.

When do you wish to vacate the property?

Ending lease early will incur a break lease fee depending on how much of

Hi Angie & Andrew 

Hope you and your family are very well.

I've received formal notice from the tenant of your above-mentioned property giving notice that they will vacate the property on 29/11/2023 as per notice required.

Reason: semester break and going back to China.

In accordance with our management agency agreement  I've commenced marketing your property for relet. 

Facts of the current rental market :

1.       Demand and Supply in the local suburb – data collected from Realestate.com.au<https://www.realestate.com.au/>

                -  About 15 properties with similar specifications are on the market for lease within 2 km

2.       Vacancy – data collected from sqmresearch.com.au<http://sqmresearch.com.au/>

            - The vacancy rate for the postcode Mascot area is 2.1%  an increase of 0.3% from Sept 2022

            - The average days vacant is 8 days

    - Please note  an optimal vacancy rate for landlords/investors would be less than 2.5%  whereas the effect ultimately leads to extended periods between tenancies.

Taking into consideration the current market  your property is likely to achieve a rental value of $900.00 - $920.00 per week.

If alternative instructions are not provided  I'll proceed to advertise your property.

If a positive reaction is not received by the coming weekend's open inspections – we may need to reevaluate the rental price. 

Please note that a letting fee equal to 1 week's rent + GST will occur upon new tenant obtained according to the management agency agreement. 

A tenancy lease preparation fee equal to $30.00 + GST will also charge upon tenant lease signed.

Upon the tenant's vacating  we shall conduct a vacating inspection to ensure that the property condition is to the same standard as when the property was leased out fair wear and tear accepted.

Furthermore  the first open inspection will be scheduled for next Saturday.

I'll relay the results and feedback of the open inspection next week without delay

If you've any further concerns or enquiries  please don't hesitate to contact me.

Hope this information assists and have a great week!

You should now arrange for the tenancy agreement to be signed and finalise the pending lodgement in Rental Bonds Online.

The online bond creation process is a three-step process: you create the pending lodgement; the tenant pays the pending lodgement and then you must finalise the pending lodgement to issue the bond number. 

To finalise the pending lodgement; 

• Log into your Rental Bonds Online account.

• Locate the pending lodgement under Agency Tasks or Your Tasks on the Home page.

• Click on the pending lodgement number and follow the screen prompts to finalise the bond.

Hi Catherina 

Thank you for your information.

The owner is very pleased that the water leak repairs are finally done. As for the rent increase  there was a plan to increase the rent by $50  making it $800 per week starting from January 2024. However  in consideration of the inconveniences caused by the ongoing repairs  the owner decided to extend a gesture of goodwill.

Instead of implementing the rental increase in January  she is willing to delay it until March 2024. This adjustment is intended to express appreciation for your understanding and patience during this period.

Please let me know whether you would accept the offer from the owner. Thank you for your understanding.

Hello both 

I'm very pleased to confirm that the carpet has finally been replaced! See attached before & after videos. I can't praise Crowsnest Floorwood  Jaye and Mohamed enough - so professional throughout and an excellent result.

The hole in the wall still needs patching  photo attached. If you could let me know when that's scheduled  that would be great. That will be everything closed off.

Jeffrey  The skirting boards weren't replaced or treated so I've cleaned as best I can. I've gotten most of the water marks off the wall too. See photos below.

Dear Edwin 

Hope you and your family are very well.

We're in the process of conducting a rental review of your property.

Facts of the current rental market :

1. Demand and Supply in the local suburb – data collected from Realestate.com.au<https://www.realestate.com.au/>

- No property with similar specifications are on the market for lease within 2 km

2. Vacancy – data collected from sqmresearch.com.au<http://sqmresearch.com.au/>

- The vacancy rate for the postcode Revesby area is 0.6%  a decrease of 0.4% from Sept 2022

- The average days vacant is 3 days

- Please note  an optimal vacancy rate for landlords/investors would be less than 2.5%  whereas the effect ultimately leads to extended periods between tenancies.

Facts of the current tenancy :

1. Your current rental income is $630.00 per Weekly since 29/10/2022.

2. Tenancy commenced on 11/09/2021 and expires on 27/10/2023.

3. Rent is paid always on time until today 08/11/2023

4. Requested reasonable maintenance during the occupancy

Conclusion :

At this stage  we would recommend offering the tenant the following 

1.	there is a possibility to increase the rent to $710.00 - $730.00 per week
2.	offer the tenant a 6/12 month lease renewal

Reason:

1.	the current rental amount of $630.00 per Weekly is lower than the current market range
2.	The expected vacancy is about 1 week

3.	For keeping a good tenant and avoid potential vacancy if the tenant vacates due to excessive rent increase amount

Please note that rent can only be increased once every 12 months.

If you have any intention to sell  move in or any factors which require the tenant to move out during this time  please advise urgently.

Await your instruction to proceed further – in the absence of your express instruction  we’ll not undertake any action and reschedule the rent review to 3 months later.

If you’ve any further concerns or enquiries  please don’t hesitate to contact us.

Hope this information assists and looking forward to hearing your consideration.

I’ve searched a bit and understood the similar apartments (no car space) in the same properties seem asking around $650 - $680. See below examples.

Do you think we can inform the current tenant of an increase to say $670-$680  and see what they say? Kindly advise.

Hi Sherry 

My apologies that the previous rental review was for a 1/1/1 car space property in Wolli Creek with similar specifications and age.

However  I just realised this property has no car space therefore  the price range shall be $630.00 - $650.00 per week.

As the $680.00 - $720.00 is incorrect  would you please advise if you agree on the $630.00 - $650.00 per week price range?

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Subject: RE: Unit 201/7 Magdalene Terrace  Wolli Creek NSW 2205 - Rental Review 20/10/2023 confirmation.
Importance: High

Hi Sherry 

Thank you for your confirmation.

A 6/12 months lease renewal offer with rent increasing notice to $720.00 per week  effective from 17/01/2024 has been emailed to the tenant by today.

*	Negotiation is acceptable between $680.00 - $710.00 per week
*	Please note that a rent increase can only occur every 12 months.

A subscribed notice period is required which needs to meet both of the following requirements 

1.      a minimum of 60 days notice period or 

2.      after the fixed term

You'd expect to receive a confirmation email from us once the tenant completes the lease renewal process.

Otherwise  it indicates the tenant is still in consideration and becomes periodic.

Hope the information assists and have a good weekend.

Kind Regards

Dear Tom 

Hope you and your family are very well.

We're in the process of conducting a rental review of your property.

Facts of the current rental market :

1.       Demand and Supply in the local suburb – data collected from Realestate.com.au<https://www.realestate.com.au/>

                -  About 5 properties with similar specifications are on the market for lease within 2 km

2.       Vacancy – data collected from sqmresearch.com.au<http://sqmresearch.com.au/>

            - The vacancy rate for the postcode Hillsdale area is 0.8%  a decrease of 0.4% from Sept 2022

            - The average days vacant is 3 days

    - Please note  an optimal vacancy rate for landlords/investors would be less than 2.5%  whereas the effect ultimately leads to extended periods between tenancies.

3.        Please find below recently leased properties with a similar specification in Hillsdale from last quarter.

<file:///C:/Users/andrewd/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.png>

Facts of the current tenancy :

1.       Your current rental income is $820.00 per Weekly since 09/02/2023.

2.       Tenancy commenced on 10/02/2022 and expires on 07/02/2024.

3.       Rent is paid always on time until today 08/11/2023

4.       Requested reasonable maintenance during the occupancy

Conclusion :

At this stage  we would recommend offering the tenant the following 

1.	there is a possibility to increase the rent to $850.00 - $870.00 per week
2.	offer the tenant a 6/12 month lease renewal

Reason:

1.	the current rental amount of $820.00 per Weekly is below the current market range
2.	The expected vacancy is about 1 week
3.	For keeping a good tenant and avoid potential vacancy if the tenant vacates due to excessive rent increase amount

Please note that rent can only be increased once every 12 months.

If you have any intention to sell  move in or any factors which require the tenant to move out during this time  please advise urgently.

Await your instruction to proceed further – in the absence of your express instruction  we’ll not undertake any action and reschedule the rent review to 3 months later.

If you’ve any further concerns or enquiries  please don’t hesitate to contact us.

Hope this information assists and looking forward to hearing your consideration.

Kind regards

Hi Andy  unfortunately I can not locate the original invoice from my email as it’s dating back to 2019 only have a screen shot per attached  

I had them made when we live in your other PIA building. Across the road and when your workers came in to fix a broken window I had another one built . 

Price as you can see from the invoice the are worth $400 each . We were given a discount but happy to see for $250 a screen as they are custom made = $1000 . Happy to negotiate if landlord can make me a reasonable offer

Also were they interested in buying the garage remote from us ?
